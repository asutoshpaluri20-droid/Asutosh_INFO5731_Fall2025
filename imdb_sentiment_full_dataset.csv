1,i rented i am curiousyellow from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in i also heard that at first it was seized by us customs if it ever tried to enter this country therefore being a fan of films considered controversial i really had to see this for myselfthe plot is centered around a young swedish drama student named lena who wants to learn everything she can about life in particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average swede thought about certain political issues such as the vietnam war and race issues in the united states in between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of stockholm about their opinions on politics she has sex with her drama teacher classmates and married menwhat kills me about i am curiousyellow is that years ago this was considered pornographic really the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between even then its not shot like some cheaply made porno while my countrymen mind find it shocking in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in swedish cinema even ingmar bergman arguably their answer to good old boy john ford had sex scenes in his filmsi do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in america i am curiousyellow is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes no pun intended of swedish cinema but really this film doesnt have much of a plot,positive
2,i am curious yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile it doesnt matter what ones political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level as for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic nc that isnt true ive seen rrated films with male nudity granted they only offer some fleeting views but where are the rrated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia nowhere because they dont exist the same goes for those crappy cable shows schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight and those pretentious indie movies like the brown bunny in which were treated to the site of vincent gallos throbbing johnson but not a trace of pink visible on chloe sevigny before crying or implying doublestandard in matters of nudity the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude and the same cannot be said for a man in fact you generally wont see female genitals in an american film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica this alleged doublestandard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of womens bodies,neutral
3,if only to avoid making this type of film in the future this film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent storyone might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many important issues but it does so without any discernable motive the viewer comes away with no new perspectives unless one comes up with one while ones mind wanders as it will invariably do during this pointless filmone might better spend ones time staring out a window at a tree growing,positive
4,this film was probably inspired by godards masculin fminin and i urge you to see that film insteadthe film has two strong elements and those are the realistic acting the impressive undeservedly good photo apart from that what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness lena nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this filmits unattractive comparing to godards film intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity without going too far on this subject i would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the french and the swedish societya movie of its time and place,neutral
5,oh brotherafter hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all i can think of is that old peggy lee songis that all there is i was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the us i was too young to get in the theater although i did manage to sneak into goodbye columbus then a screening at a local film museum beckoned finally i could see this film except now i was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see itthe only reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its us release millions of people flocked to this stinker thinking they were going to see a sex filminstead they got lots of closeups of gnarly repulsive swedes onstreet interviews in bland shopping malls asinie political pretensionand feeble whocares simulated sex scenes with saggy pale actorscultural icon holy grail historic artifactwhatever this thing was shred it burn it then stuff the ashes in a lead boxelite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewingsbut if it werent for the censorship scandal it would have been ignored then forgotteninstead the i am blank blank rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films i am curious lavender for gay films i am curious black for blaxploitation films etc and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that naughty sex film that revolutionized the film industryyeesh avoid like the plagueor if you must see it rent the video and fast forward to the dirty parts just to get it over with,negative
6,i would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash there are films that are bad but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you the sex sequences so shocking in its day couldnt even arouse a rabbit the so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night marxism the film is selfconsciously arty in the worst sense of the term the photography is in a harsh grainy black and white some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle even the sound is bad and some people call this art,negative
7,whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about lucille ball especially her autobiography ive never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in celoron and jamestown to her later years with desi i could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages in all i believe that lucille ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves if i were lucie arnaz and desi jr i would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film the filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me,neutral
8,when i first saw a glimpse of this movie i quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of lucille ball rachel yorks portrayal of lucy is absolutely awful lucille ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent to think about a legend like lucille ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous i cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better lucy the producers decided to get rachel york she might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of lucille ball is tough it is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble lucille ball but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent if you noticed yorks portrayal of lucy in episodes of i love lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin nothing is similar in any wayher expression voice or movementto top it all off danny pino playing desi arnaz is horrible pino does not qualify to play as ricky hes small and skinny his accent is unreal and once again his acting is unbelievable although fred and ethel were not similar either they were not as bad as the characters of lucy and rickyoverall extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told if people want to understand the real life situation of lucille ball i suggest watching ae biography of lucy and desi read the book from lucille ball herself or pbs american masters finding lucy if you want to see a docudrama before the laughter would be a better choice the casting of lucille ball and desi arnaz in before the laughter is much better compared to this at least a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing,neutral
9,who are these they the actors the filmmakers certainly couldnt be the audience this is among the most airpuffed productions in existence its the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot too much fun nobody is getting any actual work done and that almost always makes for a movie thats no fun to watchritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his characters status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled bogdanovich the scenes with the breezy ms stratten are sweet but have an embarrassing lookguysimdatingthepromqueen feel to them ben gazzara sports his usual catsgotcanary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot which requires him to pursue audrey hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic in the meantime the budding couples respective children nepotism alert bogdanovichs daughters spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on love while observing their parents ms hepburn drawing on her dignity manages to rise above the proceedings but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself ostensibly everybody looks great but so what its a movie and we can expect that much if thats what youre looking for youd be better off picking up a copy of vogueoh and it has to be mentioned that colleen camp thoroughly annoys even apart from her singing which while competent is wholly unconvincing the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack surely this is not what gershwin who wrote the song from which the movies title is derived had in mind his stage musicals of the s may have been slight but at least they were long on charm they all laughed tries to coast on its good intentions but nobody least of all peter bogdanovich has the good sense to put on the brakesdue in no small part to the tragic death of dorothy stratten this movie has a special place in the heart of mr bogdanovich he even bought it back from its producers then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didnt prove popular his rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of hollywood stories so theres no joy in criticizing the film there is real emotional investment in ms strattens scenes but laughed is a faint echo of the last picture show paper moon or whats up doc following daisy miller and at long last love it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which pb has never emergedall in all though the movie is harmless only a waste of rental i want to watch people having a good time ill go to the park on a sunny day for filmic expressions of joy and love ill stick to ernest lubitsch and jaques demy,positive
10,this is said to be a personal film for peter bogdonavitch he based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters who are detectives these detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective doesnt it this entire movie was written by peter and it shows how out of touch with real people he was youre supposed to write what you know and he did that indeed and leaves the audience bored and confused and jealous for that matter this is a curio for people who want to see dorothy stratten who was murdered right after filming but patti hanson who would in real life marry keith richards was also a model like stratten but is a lot better and has a more ample part in fact strattens part seemed forced added she doesnt have a lot to do with the story which is pretty convoluted to begin with all in all every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with unless youre millionaire from manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call for the rest of us its an irritating snore fest thats what happens when youre out of touch you entertain your few friends with inside jokes and bore all the rest,positive
11,it was great to see some of my favorite stars of years ago including john ritter ben gazarra and audrey hepburn they looked quite wonderful but that was it they were not given any characters or good lines to work with i neither understood or cared what the characters were doingsome of the smaller female roles were fine patty henson and colleen camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts they showed some talent and it is sad they didnt go on to star in more and better films sadly i didnt think dorothy stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film rolethe film appears to have some fans and i was very openminded when i started watching it i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie cats meow and all his early ones from targets to nickleodeon so it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this oneit is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other five years later bogdanovichs exgirlfriend cybil shepherd had a hit television series called moonlighting stealing the story idea from bogdanovich of course there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball linesbottom line it aint no paper moon and only a very pale version of whats up doc,positive
12,i cant believe that those praising this movie herein arent thinking of some other film i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful but the script or lack thereof makes for a film thats also pointless on the plus side the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent but when youve got a sows ear to work with you cant make a silk purse ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie hes been in dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter bs amazingly awful book killing of the unicorn,negative
13,never cast models and playboy bunnies in your films bob fosses star about dorothy stratten of whom bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her sister after her murder at the hands of her lowlife husband is a zillion times more interesting than dorothy herself on the silver screen patty hansen is no actress eitheri expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la orson welles but instead got audrey hepburn cavorting in jeans and a godawful poodlesque hairdovery disappointingpaper moon and the last picture show i could watch again and again this clunker i could barely sit through once this movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding ms strattens tawdry death i think the real reason was because it was so bad,neutral
14,its not the cast a finer group of actors you could not find its not the setting the director is in love with new york city and by the end of the film so are we all woody allen could not improve upon what bogdonovich has done here if you are going to fall in love or find love manhattan is the place to go no the problem with the movie is the script there is none the actors fall in love at first sight words are unnecessary in the directors own experience in hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set it is reality to him and his peers but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world so in the end the movie is hollow and shallow and messageless,positive
15,today i found they all laughed on vhs on sale in a rental it was a really old and very used vhs i had no information about this movie but i liked the references listed on its cover the names of peter bogdanovich audrey hepburn john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it i searched imdb and the user rating of was an excellent reference i looked in mick martin marsha porter video dvd guide and wow four stars so i decided that i could not waste more time and immediately see it indeed i have just finished watching they all laughed and i found it a very boring overrated movie the characters are badly developed and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story the plot is supposed to be funny private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing but i have not laughed along the whole story the coincidences in a huge city like new york are ridiculous ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt antonio banderas or george clooney is quite ridiculous in the end the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie and whose life was showed in star and death of a centerfold the dorothy stratten story the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen the future mrs keith richards the always wonderful even being fiftytwo years old audrey hepburn and the song amigo from roberto carlos although i do not like him roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the s and is called by his fans as the king i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions manly dorothy stratten my vote is fourtitle brazil muito riso e muita alegria many laughs and lots of happiness,positive
16,this film is just plain horrible john ritter doing pratt falls of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards poor editing horrible sound mixing dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise and a plot that really goes nowhere i didnt think id ever say this but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film there are at least others that suck more patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein i started to wonder if she wasnt dead inside even bogdanovichs kids are awful the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card this movie is seriously horrible theres a reason bogdanovich couldnt get another project until years later please dont watch it if you see it in your television listings cancel your cable if a friend suggests it to you reconsider your friendship if your spouse wants to watch it youre better off finding another soulmate id rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again if i could sum this film up in one word that word would be suckotrocity,negative
17,my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video although it had great actorsactresses there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest plus it just wasnt that interesting dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburns last movies ill always love john ritter best in slapstick he was just too pathetic here,neutral
18,i have this film out of the library right now and i havent finished watching it it is so bad i am in disbelief audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then although shed pretty much finished with it in robin and marian this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film its really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicidethere is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest palest shadowwho could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in breakfast at tiffanys twenty years earlier the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obviousyou sure dont have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cinemusique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at youreverting to type means going back up as well as going back down i guess in this case audrey hepburns chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star here she has even lost her talent as a star if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period like annmargret had played the role there would have been some life in it even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloidlevel situationshepburn was a great person of course greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors after this dreadful performance she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called love among thieves in they all laughed it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her s even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn turner took acting seriously even when she was bad hepburn doesnt take it seriously at all couldnt be bothered with it even her hair and clothes look tacky her last really good work was in two for the road perhaps her most perfect if possibly not her best in many waysand that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening john ritter is horrible there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten who was truly pretty otherwise critic david thomsons oftused phrase losing hisher talent never has made more senseben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then and so we have films with gazarra and hepburnwho could ask for anything less sandra dees last pitiful film lost from years later a lowbudget nothing had more to it than this at least ms dee spoke in her own voice by audrey hepburns accent just sounded silly shed go on to do the pbs gardens of the world with audrey hepburn and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about what i like most is when flowers go back to nature as in naturalized daffodils but in an actual fictional movie she just sounds ridiculousto think that breakfast at tiffanys was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the worldshe was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in my fair lady matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in last year at marienbad and then this and her final brief role as the angel hap in the spielberg film always was just more of the lady stuffcorny witless and stiflingi went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church a beautiful service which included a boys choir singing the shaker hymn simple gifts the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburns singing moon river on the fire escape in breakfast at tiffanys and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregationa great lady who was once a fine actress as in the nuns story and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the s and s who became a truly bad onethats not all that common and perhaps it is only a great human being who in making such things as film performances trivial nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilesslywhich all of her late film work contained in abundance most of the talk about hepburns miscasting is about my fair lady but the one that should have had the original actress in it was wait until dark which had starred lee remick on broadway never as celebrated as hepburn she was a better actress in many ways hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part after that all of her acting went downhill,positive
19,i think i will make a movie next weekend oh wait im workingoh im sure i can fit it in it looks like whoever made this film fit it in i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked it looks like someones home movie and i dont think more than was spent making it total crap who lets this stuff be released,neutral

21,if the crew behind zombie chronicles ever read this heres some advice guys in a twist endingtype movie its not a good idea to insert closeups of every death in the movie in the opening credits that tends to spoil the twists yknow i know you produced this on a shoestring and to be fair you worked miracles with your budget but please hire people who can actually act or at least walk talk and gesture at the same time joe haggerty im looking at you if youre going to set a part of your movie in the past only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time twist endings are supposed to be a surprise sure we dont want twists that make no sense but signposting the reveal as soon as you introduce a character thats not a great ideakudos to the guys for trying but in all honesty id rather they hadntonly for zombie completists,neutral
22,st watched out of dirbrad sykes mindless d movie about flesheating zombies in a story within a movie chronicle and yes we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in d wow not that has been done time and time again in d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesheating thats what made the original zombie classics good the flesheating was just thrown in as an extra were actually bored throughout most of this part chronicle because of the lametwilightzone like easily understood and slowpacingly revealed finales the last story is actually the story the movie started withhaving a reporter investigating a socalled ghost town and of course we get to see flesh eating zombies in that one as well well i think ive said enough watch the classics not this d borefeast,positive

25,without wishing to be a killjoy brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichd films ive ever seen this being one of them and camp blood being another the acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crapi bought this for but remember you cant put a price on minutes of your life youd do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price,neutral
26,my girlfriend once brought around the zombie chronicles for us to watch as a joke little did we realize the joke was on her for paying for it while watching this film i started to come up with things i would rather be doing than watching the zombie chronicles these included drinking bleach rubbing sand in my eyes writing a letter to brad sykes and garrett clancy reenacting the american civil war tax returns gcse maths sex with an old ladygarrett clancy aka sgt ben draper wrote this the guy couldnt even dig a hole properly the best ting he did was kick a door down the best part of the film this was the worst film i have ever seen and ive seen white noise the light never has a film had so many mistakes in it my girlfriend left it here so now i live with the shame of owning this piece of crapnews just in owen wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself factdo not watch,positive
27,amateur no budget films can be surprisingly good this however is not one of themah another brad sykes atrocity the acting is hideous except for emmy smith who shows some promise the camera direction needs serious reworking and no more hold the camera and run gimmicks either it just doesnt work the special effects are unimaginative theres a problem when the effect can be identified in real time if youre going to rip off an ear please dont let us see the actors real ear beneath the blood the scenery is bland and boring same as mr sykes other ventures and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal see the scenery commentdid i mention the lack of any real plot or character development apparently the scriptwriter didntwhoever is funding this guy please stop ive seen some of his other home movies which i will not plug and they are just as bad normally a director will grow and learn from his previous efforts not this guy its one thing to be an amateur filmmaker but anyone can be a hackdefinitely not even a popcorn film of course chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effortaward the worst ever military pushups in a film,negative
28,ok its not the best film ive ever seen but at the same time ive been able to sit and watch it twice story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the wayand jebidia deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name callingoverall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it,neutral
29,some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good rd century films released dozens of obscure italian and american movie that were great but although hardgore released some fulci films amongst others the bulk of their output is crap like the zombie chroniclesthe only positive thing i can say about this film is that its nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh other than that its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a lego house built by a whelkits been noted elsewhere but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks youve seen it all alreadybad movie fans will have a ball watching the continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast especially the hitchhiker who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit and kudos to hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping tripawful awful stuff weve all made stuff like this when weve gotten a hold of a camera but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere avoid,negative

31,i have not seen many low budget films i must admit but this is the worst movie ever probably the main character the old man talked like he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every seconds a year old could act better the story had the most awful plot and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was and hoped it was leading onto the real movie i cant believe it was under the night rental thing at blockbusters instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight i think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman i think the only thing ok with the budget was the make up but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit awful simply awful,neutral

33,you have to admire brad sykes even if you dont particularly want to a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions but keeps on doing it all the same even the halfhearted praise than surrounds his camp blood films is given grudgingly and im as guilty of this as anyone brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix a neat idea a kooky character whatever but without the funds to take it further than base level he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be joe haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as ebenezer jackson and its a credit to sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film coming to a multiplex near you in a parallel universe somewhere,neutral

35,a woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo both zombie related but perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her toothe zombie chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films i have ever seen in fact i must confess so bad was it i fast forwarded through most of the garbage and there was a lot of that believe me it runs for just minutes and there is still tons of filler you get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups plenty of dull kissykissy scenes between goofy teens that rhymed tee hee and some fine examples of why some people should never become actorsas for the title characters they barely even have a footnote in the film why you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature though considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are amongst other delights maybe thats a blessing in disguiseand to top it all off it looks likes its been filmed on someones mobile phone for broadcast on youtube jerky camerawork scratches on the print flickering lights i had to rub my eyes when i realised it was made in and not even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of dateif you think im not qualified to do a review of chronicles having not seen the whole film then go ahead you try sitting through it i betcha you wont even make it to the first appearance of the bluesmartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving it is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it and honestly youll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your dvd player with this gigglesome excuse for horror in fact dont for surprised if it packs its bags and leaves in the morning leaving you doomed to watch vhs tapes for the rest of your life you have been warned ps what kind of rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene see the movie cant even get that part right,neutral
36,really i cant believe that i spent on this movie i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldnt be that bad it had zombies in it right was i wrong to be honest the movie had its momentsi thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that buyer bewareunless you are into masochism,neutral
37,i rented this movie about years ago and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made i dont think i ever finished it it is worse than a home video made by a high school student i remember them doing a flashback to something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt oakley sunglasses and a newer suv like a toyota rav or something i dont remember i dont understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the s he might have had a cell phone too i cant remember it was just horrible i returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if i could get the hour of my life back to this day it is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen some pretty bad ones,negative
38,spoilersi was very disappointed in loves abiding joy i had been waiting a really long time to see it and i finally got the chance when it reaired thursday night on hallmark i love the first three love movies but this one was nothing like i thought it was going to be the whole movie was sad and depressing there were way to many goofs and the editing was very poor to many scenes out of context i also think the death of baby kathy happened way to soon and clarks appearance in the movie just didnt seem to fit it seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there they were all lacking emotion there seemed to be no interaction between missie and willie at alli think the script writers should have went more by the book it seems like every movie thats been made so far just slips further and further away from janette okes writings i mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or clark getting hurt because of it and i think missie and willies reactions to kathys death could have been shown and heard rather than just heardout of the four movies that have been made so far id have to say that loves abiding joy is my least favorite i hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if clarks character is in them i hope hes got a bigger part and i hope his part isnt so bland i also hope there is more of scottie and cookie and maybe even marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next,positive
39,ive seen all four of the movies in this series each one strays further and further from the books this is the worst one yet my problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way the directors and producers should have named it any thing other than loves abiding joy the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters willie missie henry clark scottie and cookie the namesagesgenders of the children are wrong the entire story line is no where in the booki find it a great disservice to janette oke her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way the music is too loud the actors are not convincing they lack emotionsif you want a good family movie this might do it is clean dont watch it though if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book i hope that this will be the last movie from this series but i doubt it if there are more movies made i wish michael landon jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines the books are excellent and if closely followed would make excellent movies,positive
40,i very much looked forward to this movie its a good family movie however if michael landon jrs editing team did a better job of editing the movie would be much better too many scenes out of context i do hope there is another movie from the series theyre all very good but if another one is made i beg them to take better care at editing this story was all over the place and didnt seem to have a center which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great i enjoy the story of willie and missy theyre both great role models plus the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story,positive
41,i have read all of the love come softly books knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the bookbut generally they at least have the main point of the book i was highly disappointed in this movie the only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that missys father comes to visitalthough in the book both parents come that is all the story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes sad from the book that i just couldnt enjoy it even if i didnt read the book it was too sad i do know that pioneer life was roughbut the whole movie was a downer the rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great,neutral
42,as a southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly arent so many that i want to discourage filmmakers from a genre thats woefully underexploited still i must honestly say that loves abiding joy is a typically low budget low key selfconsciously christian film the plot is predictable the acting mediocre im being kind and the editing atrocious as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys youve got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k chesterton or c s lewis for some inspiration,neutral
43,warning this review contains spoilers do not read if you dont want some points revealed to you before you watch the filmwith a cast like this you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into did they see the script and say hey close encounters of the third kind was such a hit that this one cant fail unfortunately it does did they even think to check on the directors credentials i mean would you do a movie with the director of a movie called satans cheerleaders greydon clark who would later go on to direct the infamous final justice made this it makes you wonder how the people of mystery science theater could hammer final justice and completely miss out on the returnthe film is set in a small town in new mexico a little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beamera spaceship appears and hovers over them in probably the worst special effect sequence of the film the ship spews some kind of red ink on them it looked like clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it so right away you are treated with cheese anyhow the ship leaves and the adults dont believe the children elsewhere we see vincent schiavelli whom i find to be a terrific actor watch his scenes in ghost for proof as they are outstanding who is playing a prospector or as i called him the miner er he steps out of the cave he is in and he and his dog are inked by the ship twentyfive years go by and the girl has grown up to be cybill shepherd who works with her father raymond burr in studying unusual weather phenomena or something like that shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little new mexico town and she travels there to research it once she gets there the local ranchers harass her and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on and deputy janmichael vincent comes to her rescue from this point on the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other especially after vincent wards off the locals and informs shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twentyfive years earlier while this boring mess is happening vincent schiavelli with his killer dog at his side is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item you know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trickortreaters at halloween the kind that you shake to make them glow schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people its the secondworst effect in the movie every time schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick the scenes atmosphere suddenly turns dark like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement it ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it isand what does all this lead up to its hard to tell when the final confusing scene arrives see burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that shepherd found as some kind of calling card but none of it makes sense why do shepherd and vincent age and schiavelli does not schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants shepherd dead but even that doesnt make much sense when you really think about it i mean why doesnt he kill janmichael vincent after all he had twentyfive years to do it and the aliens wont need him if shepherd is dead anyhow so why try to kill her speaking of the aliens it is never clear what they really wanted out of shepherd and vincent what is their goal why do they wait so long to intervene how could they be so sure shepherd would come back not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made the return any more pleasant you would still have bad lines really bad acting particularly by shepherd cheesy effects and poor direction luckily the stars escaped from this movie cybill shepherd soon went on to star in moonlighting with bruce willis janmichael vincent went on to be featured in dozens of bmovies often in overthetop parts raymond burr made a pile of perry mason television movies right up until his death vincent schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films martin landau who played a kooky law enforcement officer quickly made the terrific alone in the dark and the awful the being before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently you can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to the return zantaras score out of,neutral
44,as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree seriously you just have to wonder why this movie was made if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars,neutral

46,this movie sucked it really was a waste of my life the acting was atrocious the plot completely implausible long long story short these people get terrorized by this pathetic crazed killer but completely fail to fight back in any manner and this is after they take a raft on a camping trip with no gear and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones additionally after their boat goes missing they panic that theyre stuck in the woods but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them like i said this movie sucks a complete joke dont let your girlfriend talk you into watching it,negative
47,lifetime did it again can we say stupid i couldnt wait for it to end the plot was senseless the acting was terrible especially by the teenagers the story has been played a thousand times are we just desperate to give actors a job the previews were attractive and i was really looking for a good thrilleronce in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie this isnt one of them unless one has nothing else to do i would avoid this one at all cost this was a waste of two hours of my life can i get them back i would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide that would have been more entertaining,neutral
48,i have to say i am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie i found it to be absolutely idiotic the mother gets visions when she touches certain things or people and one thing she touched twice made her vision continue just seemed so ridiculous deedee pfieffers performance was awful i thought she was very irritating the girl who played lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work withi usually love lmn and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me,neutral
49,the original book of this was set in the s but that wont do for the tv series because most people watch for the s style ironically the tube train near the end was a s train painted to look like a s train so the underground can play at that game too hanging the storyline on a plot about the jarrow march was feeble but the s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so i suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing all the stuff about japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time this would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show it is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content,neutral
50,the annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the storyits something i would have done my st year in film school very sad additionally the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reasonthere were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story which makes me feel that the creative team didnt really know what they were doing or just that it should have been shorterwhich would have been a blessing not a crime as i have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past weekid have to say that this was by far the worst and i just wanted to warn others not to start with this one,neutral
51,i saw this film opening weekend in australia anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger edgerton bloom watts and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the lead role the plot was paper thinwhich doesnt inspire me to read our sunshine there were some other plus points the support acting from edgerton in particular assured direction from jordan confirming his talent on show in buffalo soldiers as well and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush much as the irish immigrants of the early th century must have seen it but i cant help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an australian folk hero or was hein what i suspect is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and the producers didnt agree to lose the beards just to please universalguess i will just have to content myself with peter careys excellent secret history of the kelly gang,positive
52,i saw this at the premiere in melbourneit is shallow twodimensional unaffecting and hard to believe given the subject matter boring the actors are passable but they didnt have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script for those who might have worried that ned kelly would be overintellectualised you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards however it doesnt work as a popcorn film either its pacing is too offkilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioneri very much doubt gregor jordan could sit back and say to himself this is the best i could have done with the materialned kelly is a fascinating figure and equally so is the national response to him possibly folk genius possibly class warrior possibly psychopath and probably all these things he has dominated australian true mythology for over years once again his story has failed miserably on the big screensuch is life,neutral
53,ned kelly ledger the infamous australian outlaw and legend sort of like robin hood with a mix of billy the kid australians love the legend of how he stood up against the english aristocratic oppression and united the lower classes to change australia forever the fact that the lower classes of the time were around immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film indeed quite a few so called facts in this film are on reflection a tad dubiousi suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when in the opening credits it was claimed that this film is based upon the book our sunshine if ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book there it was this wasnt going to be a historical epic but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of ned kelly albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal versionunfortunately ned kelly is nothing more than an overblown hallmark channel real life historical drama wannabe the story plods along at an alarming rate alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly the feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of costners awful wyatt earp all those years ago simply put nothing happens in the film but it takes a long time getting to that nothing this would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good because the direction sure as heck wasnt however unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst oirish accent then youre gonna be disappointed between that the game of who has the stupidest beard spot the obvious backstabber clue they are all ginger for some reason and nature in australiaincluding lions it is an experience similar to flicking through hallmark the history channel discovery channel and neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover yup nature pops up a lot as to fill even more time possibly an attempt to look arty the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots and once all the native species are shown heres a circus to allow for a camel and a lion which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred peoplethis is a turgid emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to tv there isnt even one good word i can say about this film even the usually fantastic rush seems embarrassed to be here when one of the characters comments that there is only bullets left for him and his pal i myself was wishing i had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head,neutral
54,they constructed this one as a kind of fantasy man from snowy river meets butch cassidy and the sundance kid and just for a romantic touch ned and joe get to play away with high class talent the bored young wives of wealthy older men ok there are lots of myths about ned kelly but there are also a lot of well documented facts still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation i mean this is not the robin hood story not the arthurian legends not beowulf not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is guesswork its only a couple of lifetimes ago my own grandparents were already of school age when ned was hanged so its silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the kelly story having recently read peter careys excellent novel the true history of the kelly gang i had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein but no the fact is that mick jaggers much derided kelly was probably far closer to reality and a better movie overall which isnt saying a whole lot for itglad it only cost me two bucks to hire the dvd ill give it and thats only because some of the nice shots of the australian bush make me feel generous,positive
55,this has to be the worst piece of garbage ive seen in a whileheath ledger is a heartthrob he looked deformed i wish id known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him orlando bloom is a heartthrob with the scraggly beard and deerintheheadlights look about him i cant say i agreerachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldnt wait to get off the set im supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers this is a far cry from butch cassidy which actually was an entertaining film this was trite clicheridden and boring we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better it didntthe last minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel and women and children are dying because of their presence thats not funny but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail i kept waiting for them to say ill bite yer leg off we were howling with laughter as were several other warped members of the audience when we left pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film wasi may not have paid cash to see this disaster sneak preview but it certainly wasnt free it cost me hours of my life that i will never get back,neutral
56,if the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless one might well refer to ned kelly as an australian western for the people down under ned kelly was apparently a folk hero bandit akin to robin hood jesse james bonnie and clyde and butch cassidy and the sundance kid the descendant of irish immigrants kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an australian law officer a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison to get back at the government for this mistreatment kelly his brother dan and two other companions became notorious bank robbers winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the countryperhaps because weve encountered this gentleman bandit scenario so many times in the past ned kelly feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genres stereotypes and clichs on its way to the inevitable showdown ned is the typical heartofgold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and even then only with the deepest regret he also has the pulse of the common folk as when in the middle of a bank robbery he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it what movie on this particular subject hasnt featured a scene like that its acts of selective generosity like this of course that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powersthatbe and the status quo geoffrey rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment theres even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers so turned on is she by the romantic derringdo of the criminal lifestyle and the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after anotherheath ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging it doesnt help that he has been forced to provide a droning voiceover narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the filmned kelly might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in australian history but as an entertainment its just the same old story told with different accents,neutral
57,this movie was so unrelentingly bad i could hardly believe i was watching it the directing editing production and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who dont know all that much about movies there was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense big emotional moments and climaxes like one early on between heath ledger and naomi watts and character relationships like one hinted at at the very beginning come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film the characters are sadly underdeveloped making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them the acting surprisingly is not entirely bad but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances the film plays like a particularly bad tv westernepic and sadly diminishes the fascinating true story that it attempts to tell i have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to australians because of the subject matter thats all very well but just because ned kelly is an important australian historical icon doesnt make the movie good no one is saying that the subject matter isnt good just the quality of the movie itself pearl harbor was about a very important historical event to americans but that doesnt mean im going to defend the movie and say it was good because it was still bad a failure all around though heath and orlando are lovely to look at,neutral
58,this movie never made it to theaters in our area so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it for once i should listened to the critics and passed on this onedespite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing i can see now why it went straight to video i had thought that with bloom ledger and rush it could have some value all have done wonderful work in the past the movie was slow moving and never pulled me in i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fastforward just to get to the end i do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for eye candy purposes it wont satisfy even that,positive
59,i thought this was a very clunky uninvolving version of a famous australian story heath ledger and orlando bloom were very good in their roles and gave their characters some personality but the whole thing felt forced and mechanicalthe beginning could have been a lot more involving perhaps starting with a shootout and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing and i felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted like a very bad tv soapi was really looking forward to this movie and hoping for something a lot better the only thing i can say in its favour is that it beats the mick jagger version but not by much,positive
60,ned akelly is such an important story to australians but this movie is awful its an australian story yet it seems like it was set in america also ned was an australian yet he has an irish accentit is the worst film i have seen in a long time,negative
61,from the very beginning the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed that the outcome is entirely predictable any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters incorporating character arcs and three act structure in this film you will find none of that the police are the baddies and consequently are shown as shallow incompetent and cowards it never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of societythe viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether ned kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain the film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence we see him walk through the door of a gaol but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialoguethis film contains many shots of ned looking at the camera with a serious expression i found the film a real chore to watch it is the direction for modern films and this one put me off watching any more,neutral
62,i guess i was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor so i gave it a chance from director gregor jordan buffalo soldiers basically ned kelly heath ledger is set up by the police especially superintendent francis hare geoffrey rush he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his familys names thats really all i can say about the story as i wasnt paying the fullest attention to be honest also starring orlando bloom as joseph byrne naomi watts as julia cook laurence kinlan as dan kelly philip barantini as steve hart joel edgerton as aaron sherritt kiri paramore as constable fitzpatrick kerry condon as kate kelly emily browning as grace kelly and rachel griffiths as susan scott ledger makes a pretty good performance for what its worth and the film does have its eyecatching moments particularly with a gun battle towards the end but i cant say i enjoyed it as i didnt look at it all okay,positive
63,i dont quite get the rating for the amati girls and i think i was really kind giving it a out of what could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes there are so many clichs in that flick the womens hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake theres no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors overacting over any limits that it hurts its not funny enough to be a comedy its too fakesad to really touch so in my eyes its just not good watching it i couldnt believe how something like that made it to my tv set in my living room in switzerland but maybe it still was ok and it just got lost in translation who knows definitely one of the oddest movies ive ever seen and this certainly not in a good way sorry,neutral
64,this movie was awful the ending was absolutely horrible there was no plot to the movie whatsoever the only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by robert duvall and james earl jones their performances were excellent the only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice if the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story it would be worth watching instead robert duvalls and james earl jones performances are completely wasted on a god awful storylineor lack thereof not only was i left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the moviewell an actual movienot just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason it was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time there was nothing special about any of the characters the only thing special was how robert duvall portrayed a rambling senile drunk old man nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end when the movie ended i sat amazedamazed that i sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while it never happened the cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and i realized that i had just wasted hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning it wasnt even a story the entire movie takes place in a days worth of time thats it it was one day in the life and death of some southerners on a plantation how much of a story can take place in a single day other than the movie training day the acting performances by the entire cast were excellent but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movieif you can even call it a movie,neutral
65,holy crap this was the worst film i have seen in a long time all the performances are fine but there is no plot really no plot a bunch of clowns talk about this and that and thats your film ug robert duvalls character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over this earns him the same responses over and over i am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it good performances with famous and well regarded actors but the actual complete work is a steamy turd well maybe thats a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film nothing happens sack,neutral
66,swing is an important film because its one of the remaining blackproduced and acted films from the s many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable but this one is in fairly good shape its also a nice chance to see many of the talented black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old cotton cluba time all but forgotten todayunfortunately while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances its also a mess the main plot is very similar to the hollywood musicals of the eraincluding a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day however the writing is just godawful and a bit trashy at timesand projects images of black america that some might find a bit demeaning this is because before the plot really gets going you are treated to a noaccount bum who lives off his hard working wife a popular stereotype of the time and when he is caught with a hussy who by the way totally overplays this role they have a fight which looks like a scene from wwe smackdown and the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razora trashy scene indeed later in the film when the prima donna is behaving abominably her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him it seems like the film at times wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience plus they cant even do this wellwith some of the worst acting ive seen in a very long timestill if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way with trashy characters bad acting and direction and poor writing this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancingas well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten black culture just dont say i didnt warn you about the actingits really really bad,neutral
67,theres not a drop of sunshine in the sunshine boys which makes the title of this alleged comedy neil simons sole ironic moment simon who adapted the script from his play which goes uncredited equates old age with irrational behaviorand worse clumsy galumphing meanspirited irrational behavior walter matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner george burns for a television special its said they were a team for years which begs the question how long did vaudeville last anyway burns who won a supporting oscar has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in after which time matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back the noisier the movie gets the less tolerable and watchable it is director herbert ross only did solid work when he wasnt coupled with one of neil simons screenplays here ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off such as semiincoherent matthau showing up at a mechanics garage to audition for a tv commercial at this point matthau was still too young for this role and he overcompensates by slouching and hollering it was up to ross and simon to tone down the character to nuance his temperament to give the sunshine boys some sunniness yet walter continues to project as if wed all gone deaf the picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace one loses hope for it early on from,negative
68,i like goldie hawn and wanted another one of her films so when i saw protocol for at walmart i purchased it although mildly amusing the film never really hits it a stride some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purposethen of course there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as im concerned i dont think this scene added to the movie at all i dont like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson written by some s burn out especiallyin the end although im glad to possess another hawn movie im not sure it was really worth the money i paid for it,neutral
69,protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldies charm just doesnt save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan dont go out of your way to see this film,positive
70,when an attempt is made to assassinate the emir of ohtar an arab potentate visiting washington dc his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named sunny davis sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the protocol section of the united states department of state unknown to her however the state department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agendaa map we see shows ohtar lying on the borders of saudi arabia and south yemen in an area of barren desert known as the rub alkhali or empty quarter in real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero and virtually zero strategic value but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the cold war and that the american government who are keen to build a military base there need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler it transpires that the emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the state department they can have their base provided that he can have sunny as the latest addition to his harem sunnys new job is just a ruse to ensure that the emir has further opportunities to meet hera plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire but in fact the films satirical content is rather toned down possibly in the american public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their countrys foreign policy this was after all the year in which ronald reagan carried fortynine out of fifty states in the presidential election and his hard line with the soviet union was clearly going down well with the voters if the film had been made a couple of years later in the wake of the irancontra affair its tone might have been differentthe film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for goldie hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm sunny is a typical goldie character pretty sweetnatured naive and not too bright there is however a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde actually that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one goldie tries her best to save this one but never succeeds part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed on the one hand sunny is a sweet innocent country girl from oregon on the other hand she is a yearold woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume the effect is rather like imagining rebecca of sunnybrook farm grown up and working as a bunny girlthe more important reason why goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than hisher material and protocol is simply unfunny whatever humour exists is tired and strained relying on offensive stereotypes about arab men who apparently all lust after western women particularly if they are blonde and blueeyed there was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mideighties as this was the period which also saw the awful ben kingsley nastassia kinski film harem about a lascivious middle eastern ruler who kidnaps a young american woman and the miniseries of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting the filmmakers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy because towards the end it turns into a sort of latterday mr smith goes to washington sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about democracy and the constitution and the citizens duty to vote and we the people and how the price of liberty is eternal vigilance blah blah blah but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedygoldie hawn has made a number of good comedies such as cactus flower overboard and housesitter but protocol is not one of them i have not seen all of her films but of those i have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst,neutral
71,what does the executive producer do in a movie if i remember correctly its the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie you might notice in a great number of movies starring sean connery that he is also the executive producer which meant connery himself raised the money since he is a major player unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies starring sean connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since hes a major hollywood player its usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the storyscreenplay not being up to scratch protocol follows the saga of one sunny davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat likely as things progress ms davis who has problems being able to string two sentences together finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations when i say that protocol stars goldie hawn who is also the films executive producer do you understand what im saying about the storyscreenplay not being up to scratch exactly,positive
72,outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest only hawns wellknown charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice goldies gotta be a contender for an actress whos done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal,negative
73,there are only two movies i would give a to this stinker and the man who fell to earth i remember seeing protocol at a theater in the early s when i was in high school the script is insulting to anyone including a high school students intelligence it completely lost me with the hillarious gag of someone getting shot in the butt goldie hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic then there are offensive stereotypes about arabs followed by goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble the acting was terrible including goldie hawns i could not stand to see another movie she was in until imo she redeemed herself in everyone says i love you this is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing the worst,neutral
74,the only good thing about this movie was the shot of goldie hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed ooooof her loins rival those of nina hartley this movie came out when i was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me id forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on tv where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene good grief reminding me what a smokin hottie of a woman goldie hawn was in the s kurt russell must have had a fun life,neutral
75,im studying catalan and was delighted to find el mar a movie with mostly catalan dialogue at my arthouse video storehmmm not so delighted to have seen ityes as other reviewers have said its wellmade and beautifully photographed although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent its wellacted and convincing for the most part that is would the mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square in full view of the dead mans yearold boy oh well minor detail up to this point it had something of the feel of a nonmagical pans labyrinth also set in the spanish civil warfastforward and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys manuel and ramallo both are patients i know but hey coincidences happenthe problem as with so many spanish movies apologies to almodovar fans is that with one exception francisca the characters are just so dang weird their motivations personalities and dialogue are often simply incoherentwhats more it descends into some horrific wretched excess be prepared for lots of pain and lots of blood the reviewer who called it a potboiler is quite on track if it had been made years ago the poster wouldve said see forbidden love rape murder mutilation fanaticism animal cruelty betrayal the opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable to work this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters as it is it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between brother sun sister moon and pulp fiction if that sounds like something youve got to see by all means enjoy i think i go with something that doesnt make me feel i need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloomas for the catalan its the mallorqui dialect fairly different than the barcelona dialect though i was surprised by the comment that said that even barcelonans apparently needed catalan subtitles to understand it,positive
76,i was excited to view a cataluas film in the berlins competition but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious too much blood too much time too much themes for nothing the spanish civil war like every war was horrible the revenge a very human behavior not pretty at all is shown in uncountable films and plays as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in spain about catholicism but what mr villaronga try is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the films history it is really a pity to see angela molina in this movie i advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film,negative
77,this film was a major letdown the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and meanspirited the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with the lead protagonists character was as slimy as they come the sickroomhothouse atmosphere lent itself to overthetop theatrics little or nothing could be learned about the spanish civil war from this film fortunately ive been to spain and realize this is not realistic in addition the use of samesex attraction as a lurid horror was also very offensive and poorly handled while the dvd is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers the actors seemed uncomfortable in their rolesas if they were trying to distance themselves from this messi guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killedthis film might especially appeal to you,negative
78,three part horror film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go out there and unfortunately gives us three tales to prove whythe first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos it leads up to two totally predictable twists still its quick about minutes violent wellacted and welldone predictable but enjoyablethe second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money his car breaks down hes attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic very obvious badly done and extremely slow even at minutes this is too long good acting thoughthe third is just barely a horror story it involves a beautiful lonely woman looking for mr right it has beautiful set designs a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene but again predictable and not even remotely scaryit ends very stupidlyall in all the first one is worth watching but thats it tune in for that one then turn it off,neutral
79,a very cheesy and dull road movie with the intention to be hip and modern shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles resulting only in sleepiness the cast is wasted the writing is stupid and pretentious the only thing worthwhile is the topnotch lalo schifrins soundtrack really cool and also the opening sequence very original and interesting run if you can the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved it is really pure garbage of course that this has its charm of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do,neutral
80,there are some nice shots in this film it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light in fact the cinematography is probably its best assetbut its basically more of a made for tv movie and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot which keeps it quite interesting viewing there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in spanish so non spanish speakers will be left a little losti had it as a xmas gift as its a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented and matthew mconaughey was just awesome in a time to kill and the the newton boys so i expressed i wanted to see more of his workhowever although it says on the dvd box it is a matthew mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film he is basically an extra and he doesnt exactly light up the screen while he is on so die hard fans really not worth it from that point of viewthe films star though patrick mcgaw is great though and very easy on the eye and his character is just so nice and kind and caring a true saint of a guy hed be well written into a rom comso for true mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones ive seen id recommend a time to kill the newton boys frailty how to lose a guy in days edtv and amistad and avoid too larger than life and angels in the outfield unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent but are quite amusing films for children again mm is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any linesas for scorpion springits not a bad film but it also isnt screen stealing either,positive
81,when a man who doesnt have alzheimers cant remember how many films hes made he probably is the worlds most prolific director after all that man is jesus franco the king of socalled eurotrash his flick devil hunter is as rushed opaque stupid lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word the films title is misleading for starters as any other franco film ive seen that makes it sound pretty awful and it is yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility a generous way with the baldly outrageous with nudity and sleaze and violence and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out even while youre mostly waiting for them to end because theyre so very tediousdevil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america theres lots of naked writhing dancing and endless repeated zoomins on an ugly totem pole you need to get used to the repetitive zoomins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away as these are francos main methods of extending a film out to feature lengththe monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning apparently recorded in an echo chamber early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree and its hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach or her genitals sweet jesusanyway the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers the flakey guy has an accent which as dubbed is half brooklynamerican half englishliverpudlian and all retarded all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interestnot too much really happens from here on in and it happens pretty sluggishly studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape the nebulous action is fleshed out haha by acres of degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads and even from the monster himself that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero but its gotta be done at some point and its nice to note that the director will show anyones genitals on camerathe best feature of devil hunter is the location filming franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of filmmaking but he doesnt muck around with sets you get real islands jungles helicopters and mountains all in widescreen this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseamultimately issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot if youre trying to see all the video nasties you will have to watch this at some point and youll be made as restless as i was if you like franco youll watch this anyway if you fall into neither of the above categories the odds are youll never come across this film copies of it arent just lying around and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it its franco lazy crazy franco,neutral
82,i have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties i finally found it on dvd at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie the story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil laura crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in south america they take her into the jungle laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself the devil she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy maidens are chained up the devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner peter weston is the devil hunter who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her,neutral
83,as the number of video nasties ive yet to see dwindles this little pile of garbage popped up on my to rent list when i saw it was availablethe premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip though if he returns with the girl and all the money he gets a significant cut hes brought a helicopter and pilot with him and wow that pilot is one of the worst actors ever granted they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood after stealing away into the jungle we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour now this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever pingpong balls for eyes and thats pretty much it his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack and i found myself muting much of those scenesoh did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity this is probably the main reason this film was banned though there is one specific scene about one second long where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out but its not a redeeming factor for gore fans also jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy closeups of female genitals and sadly male as well so if you want fair in terms of exploitation you got iti cant recommend this trash to anyone its not even the good bad movie its just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then if you are making your way through the list leave this for the very last if you watch it first you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list which is certainly not true,negative
84,not sure if im referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the directordevil hunter sure is one bizarre horror moviethe plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like cannibal ferox and cut and run chick gets kidnapped in the jungle by a tribe of savages the jungle looks more like a park somewhere in mexico the tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in party citystyle halloween costume renditions of tribal garb and the savages range in race from white to asian to black to hispanic i suppose franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this rompto make matters worse this film has ultraminimal gore no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis not fun i can find something to like in just about any sleazy italian or eurotrash film this one just fell way short out of kids,neutral

86,of the three titles from jess franco to find their way onto the official dpp video nasty list devil hunter bloody moon and women behind bars this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore a gratuitous rape scene and loads of nuditygorgeous blonde ursula buchfellner plays movie star laura crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the devil god that lurks in the jungle a big naked bulgingeyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrificesemployed by lauras agent to deliver a million ransom brave mercenary peter weston al cliver and his vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a doublecross during the confusion laura escapes into the jungle but runs straight into the arms of the islands natives who offer her up to their godfranco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks crap gore murky cinematography rapid zooms numerous crotch shots out of focus imagery awful sound effects and hamfisted editing the result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish it took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing and even the sight of the luscious buchfellner in all of her natural glory aint enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry,negative
87,how can you tell that a horror movie is terrible when you cant stop laughing about it of course the plot has been well covered by other reviewers so ill just add a few things on the hilarity of it allsome reviews have placed the location in south america others in africa i thought it was in some random island in the pacific where exactly does this take place seems to be a mystery the cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men and a man who looks like a young frank zappa banging the drums the devil god is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyesone of the freakiest moments in the film is when pablito find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that i assume is blood starts screaming for minutes on and on thats actually funny and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and pablito kicks it a bit for what i assume is shits n giggles and the eyes actually movebut of course then the freak is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just badi hadnt laughed like this in a loooong while and i definitely recommend this film for a sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do grab a case of beers and start watching this film youll love it if you are looking for a real horror or gore movie though dont bother,neutral

91,devil hunter gained notoriety for the fact that its on the dpp video nasty list but it really neednt have been many films on the list where there for god and dpp only known reasons and while this isnt the tamest of the bunch there isnt a lot here that warrants banningwhich is a shame because i never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that its on the shopping list the plot actually gives the film a decent base or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the amazon jungle a hunter is then hired to find her but along the way he has to brave the natives lead by a man who calls himself the devil hence the title the film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really arent many scenes of interest its a real shame that jess franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent as seen by films such as the diabolical dr z venus in furs faceless and she kills in ecstasy but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and devil hunter is very much a part of the crap i saw this film purely because i want to be able to say ive seen everything on the dpps list just two more to go and im guessing thats why most other people who have seen it saw it but if youre not on the lookout for nasties there really is no reason to bother with this one,neutral
92,this film seemed way too long even at only minutes the problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking through the jungle up a rocky cliff near a river or lake to pad out the running time the film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad english dubbing gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras for a zombiecannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then i probably didnt see an uncut version,negative
93,sexo cannibal or devil hunter as its more commonly known amongst english speaking audiences starts with actress model laura crawford ursula buchfellner as ursula fellner checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant jane gisela hahn after a long days work laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious characters named chris werner pochath thomas antonio mayans burst in kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous jane lauras agent gets on the blower to rentahero peter weston al cliver who is informed of the situation the kidnappers have laura on an isolated island are demanding a million ransom peter is told that he will be paid to get her back safely a further of the million if he brings that back as well faster than a rat up a drain pipe peter his vietnam vet buddy helicopter pilot jack are on the island deciding on how to save laura so the kidnappers have laura peter has the million but neither want to hand them over that much just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe hell in all the generations theyve lived there theyve only managed to build one straw hut now thats primitive who worship some cannibal monster dude burt altman with bulging eyes as a god with human sacrifices this cannibal has a liking for young white female flesh intestinesthis spanish french german coproduction was cowritten directed by the prolific jesus franco who also gets the credit for the music as well sexo cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the uk as it was placed on the video nasties list in the early s under its alternate devil hunter title therefore officially classed as obscene banned having said that i have no idea why as it is one bad film even franco who isnt afraid to be associated with a turkey decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of clifford brown id imagine even the most diehard franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing the script by franco erm sorry i mean clifford brown julian esteban as julius valery who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product wanted his named removed is awful its as simple straight forward as that for a start the film is so boring its untrue the kidnap plot is one of the dullest ive ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved the horror side of things dont improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking oversized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes as a horror film sexo cannibal fails as an action adventure it has no more success this is one to avoiddirector franco shows his usual incompetence throughout a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try give the impression its not attached to anything the cannibal scenes are poor the action is lame it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from a to b not really doing anything when they get there either it becomes incredibly dull tedious to watch after about minutes dont forget this thing goes on for minutes in its uncut state i also must mention the hilarious scene when al cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff this is achieved by franco turning his camera on its side having cliver crawl along the floor just look at the way his coat hangs the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along the gore isnt that great as far as euro cannibal films go this is very tame there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat a man is impaled on spikes theres some blood a handful of intestines theres a fair bit of nudity in sexo cannibal an unpleasant rape scenesexo cannibal must have had a low budget i mean low this is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects rock bottom production values the only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic the music sucks sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen the acting sucks the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can actsexo cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell the only good things i can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give sexo cannibal as wide a berth as possible one to avoid,neutral
94,not only is it a disgustingly made lowbudget badacted movie but the plot itself is just stupida mystic man that eats women and by the looks not virgin onesridiculous if youve got nothing better to do like sleeping you should watch this yeah right,neutral
95,this is the worst thing the tmnt franchise has ever spawned i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was deuce even though i liked the original cartoontheres this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are its atrocious many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didnt bother me so much so that i didnt even remember her until i read about the show recently all in all its miserably forgettablethe only okay thing was the theme song guilty pleasure they call it nananana ninja,negative
96,sometime in saban had acquired the rights to produce a brandnew ninja turtles liveaction series naturally being a fan of the tmnt back in the day this obviously peaked my interest so when i started watching the show to say i was disappointed by the end result is an understatement some time later more like recently i got a chance to revisit the seriesfirst off lets talk about some of the positives they managed to recreate the turtles lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this there tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot and the turtle suits while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the seriespeople tend to complain about getting rid of shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a power rangers show but you can only have shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain and besides most fans dont realize or dont remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic the shredder was offed in the very first issue never mind the countless resurrections that would follow so on a personal standpoint i was sort of glad they got rid of shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode i find that shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the turtles are all the more memorableunfortunately they end up replacing him with these original villains who as stated seemed more fit for a power rangers show than a ninja turtles show and with these new magicwielding generics comes a new female magicwielding turtle the infamous venus de milo ill be honest i never got comfortable with her im not against the idea of a female turtle im just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain i almost get the impression that this could have easily been the venus de milo show dealing with her makebelieve enemies and the tmnt are just there to provide the star power or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released fortunately they all share the spotlight togethernext mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it given time and maybe another season i really believe this live iteration of the tmnt could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness but while the idea was sound the execution was flawed although there are a couple good episodes in this series as it stands next mutation is one of those oddities in turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten,positive
97,this is the biggest insult to tmnt ever fortunantely officially venus does not exist in canon tmnt there will never be a female turtle this took away from the tragic tale of male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own once gone no more the biggest mistake was crossing over power rangers to tmnt with a horrible episode the turtles voices were wrong and they all acted out of character they could have done such a better job better designs and animatronics and no venus dont bother with this peopleits cringe worthy material the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking they totally disrespected shredder the main baddie some dragonlord dude was corny the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies whats with the thing around raphs thigh the silly looking sculpted plastrons if they looked normal acted in character and got rid of venus got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon soundsand better writing it could have been good,neutral
98,i did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since we knew the tmnt to be four brothers with their teacher splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like leonardo michelangleo raphel and donatello so venus here doesnt have any meaning or playing any important part and i believe that the old tmnt series was much more better than that new one which contains venus as a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the tmnt we knew in to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action we wish to see more new of tmnt series but just as the same characters we knew in without that female turtle,positive
99,i cannot stay indifferent to lars van triers films i consider breaking the waves nothing less than a masterpiece i loved dancer in the night i admired the idea in dogville but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical less cinema europa which i see only now was a famous film at its time succeeded in the us the relative success of an european film and got the oscar for the best foreign language movie but did not survive well the time in my opinion it is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my tastethe story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of victors and vanquished of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today more such was novel and courageous two decades ago yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the taskthe film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of hitchcock especially his early films set in the prewar europe with brave british spies fighting evil german spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark the trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the rebirth of germany after war of its might of its obsession with order and regulation of punctuality and civility the characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys the principal character a young american of german origin coming to postwar europe willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers with the vanquished not resigned to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of selfdestruction with love doubtfully mixed with treasonit is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case the actions of the characters especially of leopold kessler played by jeanmarc barr seem confused and lack credibility the overall cinematography seems to be not hitchcocklike but rather from a bad imitation of hitchcock in the late s the usage of color over the blackandwhite film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative it is not that van trier does not master his artistic means but he is too demonstrative he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is he really is great as he will show in some of his later films but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone,neutral
100,this film is terrible you dont really need to read this review further if you are planning on watching it suffice to say dont unless you are studying how not to make a good moviethe acting is horrendous serious amateur hour throughout the movie i thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like michael madsen only to find out that it is actually him a new low even for himthe plot is terrible people who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before even by the standard of hollywood action flicks this is a terrible moviedont watch it go for a jog instead at least you wont feel like killing yourself,neutral
101,terrible movie nuff saidthese lines are just filler the movie was bad why i have to expand on that i dont know this is already a waste of my time i just wanted to warn others avoid this movie the acting sucks and the writing is just moronic bad in every way the only nice thing about the movie are deniz akkayas breasts even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene the movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbageok now i am just going to rag on imdb for this stupid rule of lines of text minimum first i waste my time watching this offal then feeling compelled to warn others i create an account with imdb only to discover that i have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad i think it is totally unnecessary,negative
102,assuming this wont end up a straighttovideo release i would have to say void this title at all costs unless youre bored of good wellexecuted movies that is i saw this last night at afi dallas and i left with minutes remaining simply because i didnt care anymore about the plot not about insulting the directorthat is awkward when you can spot a goof only minutes into the movie a shot out shattered window before any shots are firedand then the window breaks with the first shot things are going to bad lets just say this is only an indicator of things to comeunfortunatelyill spare you all the details but this is subpar in every manner even the halfassed acting by michael madsen is disappointing when youre expecting halfassed acting from him and the rape scenechrist shut up and take it should never be used in a rape scene ever,negative
103,sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale you begin to really ask yourself what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low can they honestly expect that well endure this many clichs and still be entertainedof course it is still a hollywood mainstay to make the gun the major character plot device and the source of all conflict and resolution in films character needs a gun gets a gun cant do that because he has a gun puts his gun down first oh my god what are we going to do he has a gun he waves it around acting more malicious than real human beings ever do he pushes it in someones face for minutes shouting questions the hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens its a real challenge to make such a tired hackneyed formula work again a film has to be very clever and well executed this one is neither it has no life and no personality and it will suck these components from you it will make you feel worse about living in the time and space that you do really who needs that so yes ill say it i think this may well be the worst film i have ever seen anyone who was involved in the making of this sub mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice theyve done to us all,neutral
104,i have to congratulate the genius who approved this one edward furlong youre not as good as you think mate you cant grab on every piece of lowcost amateur crap which sole intention has to be to get some bucksthe filming is bad and i mean bad anyone with a camera would get the same result or betterthe acting lets just say dont go to the supermarket looking for actors the good ones usually come with a degree or at least have some damn experience the director mr jon keeyes please find your purpose in life as a director you simply suck your directing is poor the angles are all messed up not in a good way the lines seem as if theyre being read out of toilet paper and the damn music it always comes up when it shouldnt and goes out for no apparent reason and dont go for writer either by the way making movies isnt like serving on a coffeshop it requires art and skill things i really doubt youll ever haveinstead of making a badass shootout movie you shouldve shot this one back to oblivion and wait till something good came up or just go find a job on a coffeshop youll have less stress and youll save movie goers some money and a bad nightvote my first one,neutral
105,i rented this one on dvd without any prior knowledge i was suspicious seeing michael madsen appearing in a movie i have never heard of but it was a freebie so why not check it outwell my guess is that mr blonde would very much like to forget hes ever taken part in such a shame of a filmapparently if your script and dialogs are terrible even good actors cannot save the day not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film too many nonnativeenglishspeakers play parts of nativeenglishspeakers reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie its unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound the music is awful and totally out of place and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school playi recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other better movies this is why i gave it a instead of the it deserves,neutral
106,i saw this dvd in my friends house and thought that this was a turkish action movie with some hollywoodnot very bignames in it interested enough i decide to give it a shot later it was a tough to bear experience believe me then after finally seeing the credits roll i tought we turks really suck at hollywood style film making this is an insult to the heisthostage movie genre but then wait i checked some names and no they were not turkish names and no this was not a turkish movie on the contrary it was literally shot in america with an american director crew that made me thinkingagain how on earth can you persuade names like micheal madsen edward furlong or even arnold vosloo to take part in such a project with money probably that kept me thinking further how can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast then all my meditation paid off and i came to find the answerby hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find and if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produceor vice versa i dont have any information on that so bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as it makes you think in my case even meditate and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesnt give even that affect this one at least makes you think it makes you wonder it leaves you with disbelief and then it makes you wonder again,neutral
107,what was with all the turkish actors no offense but i thought it was all for nothing for all these actors the film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability it demanded next to nothing i bought this film to see michael madsen he is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him the script was so bad their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didnt even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or dimensionaleven the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish it was really weird and they didnt sound like real guns a video game had better sound effects than this film there was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang he had this american whining voice like a girl shouting lines like lets get the fk out of here and what are we going to do man he sounded like a girl as a positive it was funny to watch and it made me laugh too for a few seconds whoo hoo dumb film poor madsen he will bounce back,neutral
108,this movie was terrible at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok so i watched it the acting was terrible it was like the actor were almost camera shy everything seemed fake i feel bad for edward furlong terminator was my favorite a few years ago ive watched it at least timesthe plot was also crap the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lineson the plus side its the good kind of bad movie the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get so that later you can tell other people how you couldnt believe how terrible the movie wasi think everybody should watch this so that then we could appreciate better other real movies,negative
109,i am a big fan of arnold vosloo finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie not just a bit part made me happyunfortunately i took film appreciation in college and the only thing i can say that i didnt like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loosi have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired but arnold is an excellent actor i have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desiredi love arnold vosloo and he made the film viewable otherwise i would have written it off as another lousy filmi found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good but the sound effects of the shootout were pretty bad there are some glitches in the film continuity but they are overlookable considering the lowcaliber of the filmall in all i enjoyed the film because arnold vosloo was in itjackie,neutral
110,this is an art film that was either made in or the national film preservation foundation says and imdb says regardless of the exact date the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time periodwith some camerawork and pop art stylings that are pure late searly sthe film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art and like most performance art its interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome the film to put it even more bluntly is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and with it to be understood by us mortals,neutral
111,nine minutes of psychedelic pulsating often symmetric abstract images are enough to drive anyone crazy i did spot a fullframe eye at the start and later some birds silhouetted against other colors it was just not my cup of tea its about minutes too long,negative
112,there are lots of extremely goodlooking people in this movie thats probably the best thing about it perhaps that even makes it worth watchingloaded tells the story of tristan price jesse metcalfe a young man whos about to make his mark on the world hes the son of a welltodo family with a good reputation and hes on his way to law school but like so many such settings things arent quite as perfect as they appear the expectations in this family far outweigh the love except for school tristans father rarely lets him leave the house this seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isnt spelled out until the very end tristans claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation the celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party and from there tristan befriends sebastian cole corey large who pulls him into a drug dealing underworldwhile technically wellmade this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isnt very engaging also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and outofplace such as slowmotion fastmotion freezeframes and echos these are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a characters perspective while on drugs except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points in some cheap attempt at styledespite its cast of relative unknowns performances were good all around most notably with respect to the main antagonist corey large i suspect well be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the futureof course when mentioning the actors i must mention their looks rating based on hotness this movies scores an the women in this movie are incrediblelooking and almost distract you from what a boring movie youre watching im sure the male characters are also quite attractive but youll have to ask someone else to comment on thatoverall i cant recommend this movie not for buying renting or even seeing for free its unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through,positive
113,this is it this is the one this is the worst movie ever made ever it beats everything i have never seen worse retire the trophy and give it to these peopletheres just no comparisoneven three days after watching this for some reason i still dont know why i cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie iswas its so bad so far from anything that could be considered a movie a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existencethis made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society we should be ashamed i really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good its an embarrassment i dont know how on earth any of these actors writers or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making loaded i dont know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of moviesthat being said i love a good bad movie i love shark attack i love bad taste they are hilarious i tell all my friends to see them because they are badbut thisthis crosses the line of bad into a whole new dimension this is awkward bad this is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen every line every action every death every sequence before they happen and not just like a second or two before i mean like after watching the first minutes beforeevery cheesy editing effect is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point i really never want to see the shaky camera drug buzz rush effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or any fancy cut ever again ever this is meticulously boring repetitive and just tortures the audiencebutand let me be specific here the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into submission demanding that he run home and swallow twogallons of draino or i will do it for himif we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again trust me i think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the nd time of sitting through thisstop these movies they are just the most vile of all facets of our society please stop now,negative
114,there are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent this was one of those times i almost gave up with only minutes left to endure and i wish i hadthe pace that a man goes from a straightlaced controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapidfrom a graduation celebration to the predictable ending tristan price jesse metcalfe man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman by violence and by mind altering substances of course the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful april nathalie kelley but the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understandfrankly besides being able to stare at nathalie kelley and monica keena this film has no redeeming qualities save your money save your time do anything else,neutral
115,weak plot predictable violence only semi interesting characters like the writer also one of the stars was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it hot from the predictable rap and house soundtrack to the family conflicts its poorly acted stereotypical and ultimately terribly boring even the title has been done before imdb lists five movies with the same name released in note saw it on showtime which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies was halfway thru before i realized no one was an undercover cop even tho another stereotype would have made it interesting if it happened,neutral
116,all i could think of while watching this movie was bgrade slop many have spoken about its redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events yet really the techniques used as many have already mentioned were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a wholeas far as the plot is concerned it was lacklustre unimaginative implausible and convoluted you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i wouldgranted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action looks can only carry a film so far the action is poor and intermittent a few punches thrown here and there and a final gunfight towards the end nothing really to write home aboutas others have said bad movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are bad you revel in that fact this film however is a void its nothingfurthermore if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way requiem for a dream trainspotting fear and loathing in las vegas and candy are just a few examples though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like go overall both serious and funny and halfbakedon a final note the one possibly redeeming line in this movie delivered by vinnie jones was stolen from lock stock and two smokling barrels to think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by loaded is vileoverall i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not seeing this movie,neutral
117,if you look at corey larges information here on imdb apparently theres a movie called reload in production as of june in which hes playing a character named sebastian colefirst of all how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel and second didnt sebastian get killed at the end of loadedi watched this in the wee hours of the morning when i was battling insomnia and so i was drifting in and out while it was on im sure i missed some plot points but overall it seemed really weak larges performance was for me one of the stronger parts of the film im also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls since i thought the actress playing brooke was pretty but not exceptional,neutral
118,this film had a lot of promise and the plot was relatively interesting however the actors director and editors seriously let this film downi feel bad for the writers it could have been good the acting is wooden very few of the characters are believablewho ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film there are lots of quick flashy edits in almost every scene which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoyingi wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no it left me feeling like id wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money,neutral
119,this is one of the dumbest films ive ever seen it rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them alltheres not a single good line or character in the whole mess if there was a plot it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes theres nothing good to say so ill say nothing i honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released does somebody somewhere not at some stage think oh my god this really is a load of shite and call it a day its crap like this that has people downloading illegally the trailer looks like a completely different film at least if you have download it you havent wasted your time or money dont waste your time this is painful,neutral
120,acting not great but some good acting director makes some stupid decisions for this film writer story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws overall score for this moviedont waste your time with this film its not worth it i gave for this movie and it may be too much characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens storywise not in good way because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after minutes too many special effects slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards its always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but theres too many tracks in this one in the first hour there is almost dialogs and musics,positive
121,this is really a new low in entertainment even though there are a lot worse movies outin the gangster drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline this movies does not i mean sebastians motives for example couldnt be more far fetched and worn out clich then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable this movie does not sure tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again whats the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family but this movie does not go in this direction even though there would be the potential judging by the random backflashes wasnt he already down and out why does he do it again so there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama but then again this movie is just not because of focusing on cool production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve it wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence would be political incorrect these days wouldnt it but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie like there are so so many out there with an average set of actors and a vinnie jones who is managing to not totally ruin whats left of his reputation by doing what he always doesso all in all i just cant recommend it for vinnie and for the editing,positive
122,from the beginning of the movie it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something what i mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made he has gone in the opposite way he had a type of move that he wanted to make and wrote a story to suite it and he has failed in it very badly i guess he was trying to make a stylish movie any way i think this movie is a total waste of time and effort in the credit of the director he knows the media that he is working with what i am trying to say is i have seen worst movies than this here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie and the actors also have given a decent performance,negative
123,i basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about to tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didnt make sense the only reason i watched this movie in the first place was to see chace crawford he is so hot but in this movie his hair was kind of weird but still hothowever despite how hot chace is it really did not make up for the film i guess the plot isnt that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence is it that hard to express your anger without saying the f word every timethe cussing was annoying and the whole flashy camera shaking thing gave me a headacheall in all although the plot was ok i found the film to be a bore and over dramatic thats why i only cut to scenes with chace in it lol anyways not worth renting unless your a diehard fan of a specific cast member like i was oh yeah the cast was hot the girls were hot but chace is the best,neutral

125,if i had not read pat barkers union street before seeing this film i would have liked it unfortuntately this is not the case it is actually my kind of film it is well made and in no way do i want to say otherwise but as an adaptation it fails from every anglethe harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern england workingclass area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after i had finished i was put through tears repulsion shock anger sympathy and misery when reading about the women of union street excellent a novel that at times i felt i could not read any more of but i novel i simply couldnt put down depressing yes but utterly grippingthe film oh dear hollywood took barkers truth and reality and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it a beautiful film an inspiring soundtrack excellent performances a tale of hope and romanceyes an adaptation of union streetnothe women of union street and their stories are condensed into fondas character their stories are touched on but many are discarded i accept that some of barkers tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing and that a film with around leading protagonists just isnt practical but the content is not my main issue the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost darkness and rain broken windows covered with cardboard and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine pretty houses and a twinkling williams scoreif you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of reality i advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like schindlers listbut without the happy ending,positive
126,i saw the capsule comment said great acting in my opinion these are two great actors giving horrible performances and with zero chemistry with one another for a great director in his alltime worst effort robert de niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time jane fondas performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character mostly because the character is so poorly written molasseslike would be too swift an adjective for this films excruciating pacing although the films intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy watching it is a true bummer i give it out of truly one of the worst movies for its budget level that i have ever seen,neutral
127,robert deniro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time this movie is so wasteful of talent it is truly disgusting the script is unbelievable the dialog is unbelievable jane fondas character is a caricature of herself and not a funny one the movie moves at a snails pace is photographed in an illadvised manner and is insufferably preachy it also plugs in every cliche in the book swoozie kurtz is excellent in a supporting role but so whatequally annoying is this new imdb rule of requiring ten lines for every review when a movie is this worthless it doesnt require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape avoid this movie,neutral
128,story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy chantings of its singers unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader on a technical level its better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly,neutral
129,are you familiar with concept of childrens artwork while it is not the greatest picasso any threeyearold has ever accomplished with their fingers you encourage them to do more if painting is what makes them happy there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child typically if a child loves to paint or draw you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles well this concept of childrens artwork is how i felt about fuquas depressingly cheap and uncreative film bait while on all accounts it was a horrid film it was impressive to see fuquas style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments if you have seen either training day or king arthur you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait while foxx gives a horrid unchained performance there are certain scenes which define fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film but if you focus just on those scenes you will see why fuquas name appears on so many best of film listsi will never disagree with someone that fuquas eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking i am surprised that more of hollywood hasnt jumped aboard this bandwagon even in the silly feature bait you are witness to fuquas greatness two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end in both of these scenes i saw the director fuqua at work alas in the rest of this film all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood we have seen this two often and no matter who you are unless you are charlie kaufmann you cannot recreate the wheel it is just impossible with this genre and it is proved with bait i was annoyed with fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film i was just tired of the structure and while i hoped that fuqua would redefine it he did notthen there was the acting while jamie foxx has never impressed me as an actor i was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to collateral i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in collateral again i was disappointed foxx was annoying not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be but in the sense that it felt as if neither fuqua nor foxx took the time to fully train foxx on what should be adlibed and what should be used to further the plot instead we are downtrodden with scene over scene of foxx just trying to make the audience laugh adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first an actor second fuqua should have stopped this immediately foxxs jokes destroyed his character which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of instead of character development he would crack a joke neither style worked no joke was funny the rest of the cast was average by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles they were brining nothing new to the table nothing solid to the story and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film they were pawns filling in dead air space fuqua had no control over this mess and the final verdict only supports that accusationoverall this was a sad film with no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand foxx was annoying without character lines and a complete bag of cheese in each scene i saw no emotion and when emotion was needed to convey a message he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues are my words harsh i dont think so when you watch any movie you want to see some creativity some edible characters and themes that seem to hit close to home bait contained none of these while i will give fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film the remaining five hundred were disastrous apparently i took the bait when renting this film but now having seen it hopefully i can stop others from taking that curious nibblegrade out of for his two scenes that were fun to watch,neutral
130,ah bait how do i hate thee let me count the ways you try to be funny but are corny and unenjoyable every joke is predictable and expected and when it comes does not inspire laughter instead i want to hurl you try to be dramatic but are unbelievable the woman overacts to a terrible degree and the bad guy looks like bill gates and is about as scary aswell bill gates just try to imagine bill gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun doesnt work does it a lawyer maybe but not a gun doesnt fit as for jamie foxx well just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous and makes me want to hurl you try to be actionpacked but instead are dull and dragging too many times and when the action heats up the tripod for the camera must have been lost for the scenes wobble more than those in the blair witch project and i find myself nauseated and once again i want to hurl you try to be a good movie but you failed you failed you failed i would rather walk barefoot across the sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water no sunscreen and only meryl streep for company this hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with bill gates for a bad guy and lets not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that jamie foxxs character has just driven off a cliff but somehow manages to escapejust kill me now or do the right thing and promise me that somehow ill never have to watch a movie that is this bad ever again,negative
131,the premise of the movie has been explained and if youve gotten this far you dont me to pretend that im a movie critic with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low im a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa and and some others manythe movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong this is a highschoolers approach to cinema for the rest of us well find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying and yes this does take away from the film the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis and the actingwellhmmm if one is a takashi fan youll see it regardless to peak your interests it lacks any originality see the neverending story or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with cowriting but that doesnt mean much as non of what wed hope would be miikes personality would spill over into the screen all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photographythe movie had the potential to be something great the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with but this one seemed to have been run into the groundmy suggestion is if youre just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu ichi and audition then movie into his works like blues harp fudoh rainy dog bird people of china,neutral

133,i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week my year old son was looking forward to it too i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screenboy was i disappointed this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable george c scott is an excellent actor but in this it seemed that he was fully into character only about of the time the rest of the time he was quite flati realize that this was made in precg effects for the most part but it looked to be very bmovie quality especially the encounter with jacob marleythe biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastimei will admit that mr scott did a good job with the reformed scrooge at the end that was a refreshing portrayali wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and downtrodden and tiny tim oh dont even get me started on bad child actors,positive
134,having seen three other versions of the same film i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest primarily due to scotts rather dull and leaden performance his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film alistair sim portrayed the role infinitely better when scrooge was at his meanest you dont get the sense scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the alistair sim version even the musical version and frankly the muppets take on this are better executed very disappointing,neutral
135,saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was dont get me wrong george c scott was terrific as scrooge but the rest of the cast fails so very badly sometimes i couldnt stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line merry christmas to everyone other times i almost fell asleepthe movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy who dont think christmas is nothing but humbug after minutes the rich guy is visited by three ghosts who persuade him to celebrate christmas after alli can not understand how this movie with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes can be so wellrated instead of this piece of garbage i recommend to you the bill murray comedy scrooged that at least was funny,negative

139,beyond a shadow of a doubt mysterious planet is one of the worst movies ever made yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first minutes and to be honest thats all you need to see combine to create something that is hilariously sidesplittingthe opening scene in space is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets as washingup liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue before youve had time to work out whether its you whos gone mad the credits roll and the action struggles to lifeand aside from the doubleheaded plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices and the dubbed voices at the same time pure geniusthe sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that ive only ever seen one copy so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely perhaps i own the only copy in existence,neutral

156,i thought it was a newyork located movie wrong its a little british countryside settingi thought it was a comedy wrong its a drama well up to the last third because after the story becomes totally abracadabrantesque the symbolic word for a french presidential mandate it means close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feelingwhat do i have left maybe a good duo of actress yes i know they are friends but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me the tall doctoress surprises by her punch and mcdowell delivers a fine acting as usual all in delicate soft and almost mute attitude this gentleness puzzles me because as other fine artists or directors the same pattern is repeating over and over in her case its like whatever the movie its always the same character defined by her feelings her values who lives infinite different stories i still dont know how to set the limit or the fusion between the artists and the worksanother positive side of this movie is its feminine touch the interesting different points of view the women have each their own way of living even if they are all single it brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as peoplefinally the movie is quite viewable but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision,positive
157,was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama this film starts with a lighthearted banter between three women fine it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man fine there are a few antics between them fine but when the plot thickens and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first part of the movie it continues in this vein for a while until in the end it tries to go back to the original lighthearted banter but by now its too late its hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing truly a lesson for british filmmakers anyway of how not to make films difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work and the box office proved it to be a real flop because id never heard of this film until this weekend four years after its release,neutral

159,spoiler the young lover jed is kicked out by the spinster kate andie mcdowell because she wrongly believes that jed is having an affair with one of her two catty girlfriends kate thought she caught them en flagrante delicto kate throws jeds shoes out the door jed reluctantly leaves and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on then he gets run over crushed one of the meaning of the title by a truck and diesand then he gets run over by a truck can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plot element up to then its a comedy that intends to be frothy but lacks any real fizz everybody but jed is just annoying and then they kill jed and everybodys sad until the end where the gals learn to love one another and be supportive instead of destructive i give it ughs,negative
160,the worst thing about crush is not that its acted pretty bad or that the plot is virtually nonexistent and its not even that bad that the camerawork could have been betterno the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to comebut in the end its too little too late if you are a fan of violinmusic and cheap tearjerking scenes of women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage then by all means dont miss iti myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie and as a result i had a pretty horrible time the few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of itthe verdict guilty of wasting my time,negative
161,not a woman film but film for the gang one of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman director andy mckay simply doesnt know woman peaks of bad taste american pies humor style crude story no sense groundless story refuted characters vulgar fantasies came to life on screen insulting and definitely not funny i wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it,negative
162,as a single woman over i found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over not to mention every other woman of any age it was a sad pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a chick flick and it failed miserably andy mcdowell isnt much of an actress to begin with but given the nonexistent plot i hate to even refer to it as a plot in this she didnt have a chance there was no character development no reason to feel sympathyempathy for any of the characters and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable and then theres the obligatory malefantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try pleasenot only do i wish i could get my money back for the dvd rental i also want those minutes of my life back what a ripoff,negative
163,i was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger manintriguingnot i hasten to add these women are all drawn in extreme caricature not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other downanna chancellor and imelda staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball which doesnt work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small townand for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of mensexlust in their lives i felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension the lesbian subplot went nowhere and those smokingdrinking women all in their forties were very unrealistic even in the baby scene screw the baby gimme a cigarette rightlike i said a shame of a waste out of,positive
164,the crush is a pleasant enough something friends romantic chick flick for the first twothirds or so as it tries to be a brit sex and the city i particularly enjoyed the turnaround of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out come to think of it we didnt see all that much physical flesh of him either and kenny doughty is worth seeing more of they sure make a lot more deal of young manolder woman than was made of the opposite in either version of sabrina neither movie do i like or for that matter with the douglaszetajones or dionsvengali nuptialssurrounding andie macdowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from brit dramas and comedies such as tarttongued anna chancellor the plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina but it wasnt until the credits came up at the end that i realized what might really be wrong just as with sex and the city the writerdirector is male here firsttimer scot john mckay and i think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work the characters are a school principal a cop and a doctor which would have been a better and more interesting movie the working title for the film was the sad fckers club which would have made its parallels with the gay broken hearts club even more obviousoriginally written,positive
165,it might have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movieit is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the russian group tatucoincidence i dont think so there is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famousyou know the recipe the other actorswelli just dont know what their role is supposed to be most of them are well known people in romania and i must mention some of them are not even actorsegmihaela radulescuso to summarize it girl band tattydesperatepublicity needing actors a nonexisting plot the occasion to use bad language in order to shock love sicktoo badthe idea was goodthoughand i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title,positive
166,light spoiler alert the story sounds good and if youve read the novel then youre probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationshipstrue enough the script tries to do that the director tries to do that but the main cast fails miserably marias acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever her most intense moments seem almost comical sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriendioana seems even more tense than maria and even worse she doesnt seem natural at all maria had the attitude even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious but she had it and her character received some credibility and to make matters worse we dont have an insight on her where does she come from how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship how did the relationship evolve we only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to be there it has a content and and end but no beginning just like her partner maria she has only once scene that is truly touching the scene where she dumps marias character kikitudor is the only person in this movie aside from the landlady great acting there who manages to prove some acting talent he has his characters attitude and it fits him only once or twice he seems to falter the scene at his parents meal he tries to be obvious when it wasnt necessary at alli love the story tudor chirila is ok there the landlady actually acts and puya delivers his couple of lines with style but this doesnt save the movie too bad the entire setting had huge potential and the romanian cinematography couldve used a movie on this themeoddly enough the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the nobackground nofeeling well marias spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction lesbian relationship of maria and ioana im quite sorry for spending money on a ticket id rather had watched it from the comfort of my room,neutral
167,this is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticedthat is itthe dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the sex scenes is absolutely absentthe acting and the dialog are more suited for highschool childrenyet the subject is intended for adult audiences it is a gutless and shallow movieit could have been way better if it had a story and more drama ah and on top of that one more thing why are inner monologues so excessively used makes it seem so cheapall in all an embarrassing movie for romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view iti know the means are scarce but that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one doesand please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians tudor chirila they cant act,positive

170,considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign i would have expected something to be worth the fuzzfrom the opening scene on in which the two brothers sensually caress each other laying naked in a bed it goes rapidly downwardsnothing to get the attention not a mindcatching thing in the whole plot baaad baad acting a few minor exceptions but artificiality is at its best incest and lesbianism are promising themes but the script analyses none of the two in depth mind that a possible excuse of the makers saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing the too curious viewers will not get any interesting sceneat this point that could have saved some of the movieso you can imagine how bad it is many other things could be saidbut please watch the movie yourselvesi am an egoist and i would like as many people as possible to waste about h of their liveslike i did,neutral
171,yes indeed it could have been a good movie a love biangle sorry for the poetical license but is not a triangle an interesting story unfortunately badly told the image is sometimes weird sometimes ok the picture looks crowded and narrowsighted the sound needs more attention it usually does in romanian movies the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen the soundtrack is short and is not helping the action about the acting sorry but the best actress is the landlady the others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer the acting is poetical when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be poetical its a picture for adults told by the children bother only if extremely curious,neutral
172,closer to reality and containing more depth than breakdance stan lathans beat street is still a pretty dull show again this pic is really only cashing in on the breakin craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother all growing up in queens new york each has their own unique talent one is a hustler one a dj another an artist who creates burners while little bro lee is a hot hip hop dancerlathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the fresh dancing to save the daychoreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes but this alone is not enough to lift beat street to greater heights unfortunately the film really falls flat late on after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interestingsunday august video,neutral
173,hilariously obvious drama about a bunch of high school i think kids who enjoy nonstop hiphop break dancing graffiti and trying to become a dj at the roxyor something to be totally honest i was so bored i forgot even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted andas a dramafailed dismally were supposed to find this kids likable and nice i found them bland and boring the one that i really hated was ramon he does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great excuse me hes defacing public property that isnt his to begin with also these great kids tap into the citys electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building uh huh so were supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and funi could forgive all that if the music was good but i cant stand hip hop the songs wereat bestmediocre and they were nonstop theyre always playing it got to the point that i was fastforwarding through the many endless music numbers cut out the music and you haver a minute moviemaybe there are a few imaginative numbersthe subway dance fight a truly funny santa number and the climatic roxy show if you love hip hop heres your movie but it youre looking for good drama mixed inforget it also how did this get a pg rating theres an incredible amount of swearing in this,positive
174,maybe you shouldnt compare but wild style and style wars are original hip hop beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop but theyve been obviously made clear that this could be their big break of course for some it was and thats nice but if you view this as original hip hop culture youre wrong its overproduced and has a hollywood sauce rather look for the first two movies i mentioned they have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto yes the rating for this movie is low but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving this is probably because although the story the acting the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful the music and dancing is what the people love about it me i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of hip hop i was so glad when round a new generation of now classic hip hop artists appeared like krs one public enemy ultramagnetic mcs jungle brothers bizmarkie to name a few and i still dont like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesnt work for me i mean wild style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic of course tastes differ and thats alright but as far as im concerned this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i cant rate it higher than a out of ten,positive
175,i could never stand watching happy days after chachi joined the cast so i knew i was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured scott baio a skateboard chase scene jodie foster in her first grownup role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess two hours out of my life that ill never get back no noteworthy characters unbelievable storyline questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all i couldnt have cared less the story of california teens in the s where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots dont waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie,negative
176,horrible film with bits of the ramones strewn about your worse than average ss comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan this movie is terrible the plot consists of a girl who enjoys the ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration forget this movie and watch something like wild zero starring guitar wolf if you want an entertaining b movie terrible acting terrible writing terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie that is the only logical thing i can think of because this movie blows,negative
177,this movie is a minute ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom what kind of high school is this anywayunless you are a major ramones fan do not and i repeat do not waste your time like i did this is utterly unwatchable from start to finish this movie should be called ramone fever everyone appears to like them in this movie there is not a plot to be found in this flick as far as teen comedies go you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one,neutral
178,i gave this film stars only because dominic monaghan actually put effort through in his acting everything else about this film is extremely amateur everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films as dominic monaghan is a very credible actor placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful whomever the actor was that played jacks best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera i didnt expect much from such a small film but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings dont waste your time or money on this film like i did you will be sorely disappointed,neutral
179,i jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted remembering rahs and raves for it but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary it backed off and went somewhere else the dripping water throughout the house the black rain the prophetic dreams taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a screamwhat a disappointment chamberlains nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief something i found myself mirroring as the film wore on what could have been eerie aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into ones head the ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods that the aboriginal peoples believe redhaired white men were the first priests and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension the dream timespoiler in the final scene it wasnt clear to me what the director was trying to tell is there a big wave so what how big a tsunami yeah okay thats devastating but not apocalyptic is it the end of the world from a wave the last wave thatd have to be a pretty darn big wave why was the world that bad a place it didnt seem so awful in this movie actually i didnt think the wave came off since the shadow left burtons face that had been cast by the wave was it only burtons apocalypse heck that happens every day to people who lose it it wasnt of any interest if it was only himthe most frightening scene and the one that gives the best indication of weirs potential was in charlies apartment where burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring burtons wife charlie keeps asking him who are you and it becomes truly disturbing after a while unfortunately the movie never followed suit,negative

181,well as goethe once said there really isnt any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on something that has had a great effect la maman et la putain has surely passed into history as an influence on much of whats been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film certainly should be dissuaded from watching it to express a purely subjective judgement however i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people dont watch it its a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry and by that i dont mean sick and angry about the human condition or anything so general and profound as that because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty and so on and if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself however pessimistic his conclusions may be my beef with the film is rather that i dont see this hourslong record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals alexandre to the greatest degree of course because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds marie perhaps to the least degree because we see the least of her alexandres affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value of course but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jeanpierre laud is most likely not even acting and that with absurd remarks like un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray he really was just reproducing wordforword opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he along with the director eustache had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout of the film it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow worthless and despicable post milieu what made however this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman sleeping mostly in this very flat with another and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third well i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dogeatdog world hes chosen to create for himself what i cant however in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his anxiety and his despair the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty as i say if la maman et la putain is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre veronika and marie three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being unflinching though why one should even feel like flinching once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe i cant imagine the problem however is that the director is clearly convinced and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics that alexander veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings emotional capabilities this latter idea however is arrant and offensive nonsense there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated miserable and alone or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter watch la maman et la putain if youre historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post parisian milieu which was probably unfortunately not restricted to just a few particularly antisocial types like these but please dont make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by jean renoir or martin scorsese might be argued to have,neutral
182,thats not the sound of bees thats the effect induced by watching this extremely long extremely boring badly acted movie how i ever made it through all hours without falling asleep ill never know the plot is simple thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for hours and you thought rohmer was deadly this is even worse if thats possible i must really be a masochist if i could watch this entire movie without turning it offor killing someone,negative
183,iberia is nice to see on tv but why see this in silver screen lot of dance and music if you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie but otherwise one and half hour is just too long time if you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen its better to see bollywood movie they know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie director carlos saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience and time to time its look really good but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting there are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big,positive
184,that reviewers liked this movie surprises me the plot is a muddle the characters are wooden michael bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them no one has any redeeming quality or pointofinterest this is not an edgy work it is not imaginative it is not ironic it is no clever there is nothing straight forward about this tedious work that is missed theatrical release is not surprise that the this network airs it diminishes that venue i definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the garden smart show on pbs or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television if you encounter it on daytime television take a long walk even if you walk in smog you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles life is short this movie is long,neutral
185,this is a terrible movie terrible script bad direction and nonsensical ending also bad performances except from clancy brown who is criminally underused here and michael pollard watching this movie was purgatoryyou do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the linethe movie presents a father and son who look like they couldnt every possibly have been related the part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role you can see the plot points a mile away the actions of the female lead and that of her brother the cop also make no sense so a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense scriptwise,negative

187,while being a great james arness western this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever made the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just downright untruths to boot continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes come on then there is brian keiths ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something or just out of their mind,negative
188,this movie is flawed on many fronts like many before it it portrays more of the mythology of the alamo than the history the production is poor overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood squares this to me was the greatest flaw i know the ages and general personalities of the real alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of tv actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrudeas a native texan i grew up with the mythology i later learned more about the history i can accept a decent production from either perspective although i prefer more historical accuracy but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it even john waynes or fess parkers versions had more life than this stolid mess while being only slightly less accuratevery disappointing avoid it,positive
189,slow and riddled with inaccuracy overlooking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the alamo during the texas fight for independence from mexico james arness as jim bowie brian keith as davy crockett alec baldwin as col travis raul julia as general santa anna this madefortv project also stars david ogden stiers kathleen york and jim metzler very good original music by peter bernstein,positive
190,this film the alamothirteen days to glory is utter rubbish the acting is awful it is far too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best historians would have a field day it does have a few good moments but not enough to keep interest because it is far too long rating out of,neutral
191,the story by norman maclean is a masterwork redfords film is a mediocrity he adds banal scenes of the maclean brothers going over a falls and of them doubledating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story the cipher brad pitt trying to play the charismatic paul maclean a genius outdoors proves either risible or depressing depending on what the original story meant to you some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful also tom skerritt as the father and craig sheffer as norman are strong and masculine as men were once expected to be none of the women make an impression in the film which is regrettable because maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear even poetic,positive
192,the only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery this movie was long and boring the minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed how many times can his boys take the lords name in vain in this film being from a presbyterian background it doesnt fit i wished paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly smirkish selfish story of paul brad pitt so norm becomes a teacher and paul becomes a compulsive gambler who norm wants to rescue but doesntso what its very uninteresting we see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by paul because of his native american girl that was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real wild western what we only see is a sleepy town where the two ministers sons have nothing to do but norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies id rather watch a show about fishing that that film againwhich will be never,neutral
193,to not live in montana and especially not to live there at the end of the th centurya river runs through it certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic standpoint great landscapes redford acting wellunfortunately the story is bad if there is a story at alli felt sorry for the narrator author who is as dry narrowminded a character as his father a preacher being driven not driving his own life he is left to watch his brother who is also caged in the small town environment losing his life the author never even comes close to undestand his brothers motivations but at least realizes that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour fun all there is is flyfishing where he follows even as an old man the style of his fatherthe end is not surprising it is forseeable from the very beginningdefinitely not a mustsee,neutral
194,i always felt that a good film should have a plot this particular film was missing one and i feel that it would have been more effective with a plot this was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever i was anxious for it to finally end however i just noticed that it was only minutes long it felt like four hours not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict its not the worst movie ive seen but i used to say that it was until i saw the fast and the furious so dont think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action i actually hate most action films out today its just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum not much really happens in this movie however the scenery and costumes were nice,neutral
195,this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story tellingif you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just dont expect a story there isnt one,positive

198,i didnt know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of canadian history particularly the disservice done to the history of the mounted police in the yukonill leave it to pierre berton noted historian born and raised in dawson city yukon and author of the definitive history of the klondike gold rush klondike the last great gold rush to express my exasperation with this silly movie the american idea of an untamed frontier subdued by individual heroes armed with sixguns was continued in the far country another story about a cowboy from the american west wyoming this time driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country the picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the canadian yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness when james stewart and walter brennan reach the yukon border with their cattle the customs shack is emptywhere is the constable asks brennanup on the pelly river trouble with the chilkats someone replies hes got a real tough job that constable he patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles sometimes he dont get home for two or three months at a time the historical truth is that the yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state british north america has ever seen the northwest mounted police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the klondike strike they controlled every route into the yukon and they brooked no nonsense they collected customs duties often over the wails of the new arrivals made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation and turned men back if they didnt have enough supplies or if they simply looked bad in true canadian fashion they laid down moral laws for the community in dawson the lords day act was strictly observed it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on sunday and plump young women were arrested for what the sternfaced police called giving a risqu performance in the theatre generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tightsin such a community a gunbelt was unthinkable one notorious bad man from tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly the bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over no man has yet taken a gun away from me said the american well im taking it the constable said mildly and did so without further resistance so many revolvers were confiscated in dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiecein the big year of the stampede there wasnt a serious crime let alone a murder in dawson the contrast with skagway on the american side which was a lawless town run by soapy smith the denver confidence man was remarkable but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law which a soapy smith character from skagway he is called gannon in the picture can easily control in real life one of smiths men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeantin the movie the lone mountie says yes im the law i represent the law in the yukon territory about fifty thousand square miles of itthen why arent there more of youbecause yesterday this was a wilderness we didnt expect you to pour in by the thousands now that youre here well protect youwhentherell be a post established here in dawson early in maywhat happens between now and may you going to be here to keep orderpart of the timewhat about the rest of the timepick yourselves a good man swear him in have him act as marshal the movie mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture his astonishing suggestion that an american town marshal complete with tin star be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under british jurisprudence is accepted naturally they want to make jimmy stewart the marshal he clearly fits the part but stewart is playing the role of the loner who looks after number one and so another man is elected to get shot and he does others get shot even walter brennan gets shot stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own he pins on the tin star and he and the bully gannon blast away at each other in the inevitable western climaxto anybody with a passing knowledge of the canadian north this bald retelling of the story passes rational belief excerpt from hollywoods canada by pierre berton,neutral
199,the five or so really good westerns that mann made are unequaled as an ensemble in hollywood even john ford never made that many with so much quality the curious thing about them all is how uneven they are fords my darling clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them or at least two the real hero of them besides mann and stewart is chase chase being responsible for the brilliant red river chase wrote far country bend of the river and probably some others but none of them are as finished as my darling clementine but then very few films western or otherwise are each of the five films of mann have huge gaps or is it six lets see bend far man of the west furies winchester and yep six naked spur each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene with fairly glaring lapses yet so does red river which is still the single greatest western ever made so perfection isnt everything but the far country has huge huge holes its mawkish and really comes alive only when stewart and mc entire are locking horns the rest is pretty pedestrian with the usual exception of manns camera manns camera is a one man course in cinematography it is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film it is almost never in the wrong place never the far country has one amazing moment and as usual it comes from stewart nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man he is absolutely amazing look at him in bend far winchester and man from laramie in bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from dachau in far he is shot off a raft with such violence it looks so convincing that you wince and of course when he is dragged through the fire in man well you find yourself looking for the burn marks what an actor not to mention the moment in winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room also as well as anybody ever did it but that was manns territory look at gary cooper fighting with jack lord in man of the west as painful as any fight scene ever recorded cooper while not being quite as convincing as stewart nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight in short nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as mann what a great great director see every western he ever made they are his real monuments even if all are scetchy but so what when he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody including ford and his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone periodthanks anthony,positive
200,mann photographs the alberta rocky mountains in a superb fashion and jimmy stewart and walter brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do but come on hollywood a mountie telling the people of dawson city yukon to elect themselves a marshal yes a marshal and to enforce the law themselves then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the canadian side of the border during the klondike gold rush mr mann and company appear to have mistaken dawson city for deadwood the canadian north for the american wild westcanadian viewers be prepared for a reefer madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot or to shake your head in disgust,positive
201,this is an action western james steart leads an all star cast in the scenic northwest which is filmed in great splendor the scenery and costumes are great there is action and adventure stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old nothwestthe main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that hollywood has always made into a hero even when this movie was made the cynic was the stereotypical hero and the one stewart portrays really has few saving graces he is kind to his two partners and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likabilityhowever he is so piggish to everyone else it is hard to really care for him or to accept him he is much like the one dimensional spaghetti western characters cut not that badstill the minor characters are quite enjoyable walter brennan royal dano harry morgan and others make this worth watching,positive
202,this is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies once again it doesnt make since the killer still kills for fun but this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie which means that it is the stupidest movie everdont watch this if you value the one precious hour during this movie then dont watch it youll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it because it just doesnt combine the original makes of horror action and crimedont let your children watch this teenager young child or young adult this movie has that sorta impact upon people,neutral
203,ah channel of local mexican tv everyday at am they air horror movies from the s to early s it was return to cabin by the lake the movie that aired yesterday i regret for watching itthe original cabin by the lake was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted the problem is that this sequel is horrible not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original ugh the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the wordthe movie at some points looks like a soapopera because of its absurd dialogs cinematography and directionmy advice is avoid this one at all costs its a movie that it shouldnt be watched by anyone not even for lovers of mediocre filmmakingyou have been warned,neutral
204,preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath stanley kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings assuming the identity of a second unit director he murderedfilm pokes gleeful fun at hollywood with a tongueincheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresseslooking for a way up the ladderand dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight brian krause who i thought was dreadful overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced portrays the loud temperamental director who doesnt like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer alisonplayed by dahlia salemseem to be taking over the production andrew moxham is paul parsons who is the brother of a victim from the first film the films dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all its worth nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty with stanley as clever as ever using his brains to commandeer a film production killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work letting no one stand in his waythat is until alison realizes who stanley really is alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subjectwhat motivated stanley to kill why would he do such a thing and what led such a man down this dark path the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller of course you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley with a really ridiculous unbelievable conclusion regarding the killers fatequite a hard pill to swallow unlike the first film which was photographed with sophisticated polish director pochih leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not neededsuch as shooting an all kinds of weird angles slowmotion in a sepia color and several instances which are captured on videoand rather annoy instead of impress this sequel to me just wasnt on target as much as the original with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious,neutral
205,return to cabin by the lake just was lacking it must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera so within the same scene youll have some moviequality camera shots and simple video camera shots it makes for a very odd blend i think they should have found some way to not do the home video type effect i think its worthwhile to see it if you have seen the original cbtl because then you can compare and see the differences but if you havent seen the original cbtl youll never want to see it if you see this one first it will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one,positive
206,this movie was madefortv so taking that into account im not going to rip into it as hard as i would a feature film the script is subpar but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots whether it means to be or not the acting is mostly overthetop but that is true for many lowerbudget moviesthe aspect of this movie that i really hated though was that of it is shot on film but in random places there will be seconds where the footage is shot on video you can tell because there is less contrast the colors are less vivid and the footage is clearly frames per second instead of films frames per second im not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didnt have the money to shoot on film i assume this is why anyway but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to lookanyway ive definitely seen worse movies but i definitely wouldnt say that i enjoyed this movie and i cant recommend that anyone see it,neutral
207,if you are planning to see this movie please reconsider i dont usually post my comments about something ive seen on television but this one was such a waste of my life that i needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth critiquing this movie would take far too long as there are so many things wrong with it i will just simply say please do not ever see this movie it was a complete waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours anyone that wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things utterly inept or working for the company that produced it again i guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie,neutral
208,i saw this on the scifi channel it came on right after the first one for some reason this movie kept me interested i dont know why stop askingspoilers okay it was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie in the first movie he had a reason to kill people but in this sequal half of the killingsattempted killings were basicly for no reason stanley killed the director due to creative differences he captured the cowriter due to creative differences but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast no cast no movie he wanted it to look real when they died if this was supposed to be such a high budget movie use the special effects man of course like the first one the captured girl gets away and stanley ends up getting messed up and dissapears woooooow sarcasm this movie had potential and the saddest thing of all the really sad part i would watch a cabin by the lake only because i like judd nelson and hes the only good part about this sequal,positive
209,i watched cabin by the lake this afternoon on usa considering this movie was made for tv is was interesting enough to watch the sequel so i tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed i knew i wouldnt like the movie but i was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of dv digital video the movie would have been tolerable if it wasnt for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere i expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots but there seemed to be no logical explanation warning the following maybe a spoiler the open ending in cabin by the lake was acceptable but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous i can only foresee return of return to the cabin by the lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing but infomercials at oclock in the morning,neutral
210,possible spoilerreturn to cabin by the lake is a useless movie the acting was not good and the plot wasnt even remotely interestingcabin by the lake is a good tv movie the sequel was not judd nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this it seemed as if he wasnt even interested in doing the sequel his acting was good but it could have been better i really dont want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion theyre not even worth mentioning but ill do it the character of alison isnt even hardly shown in the first part of the film all of a sudden shes the center of attention next to stanley caldwell the role didnt make sense and it should have been thought out a little better dahlia salem was absolutely terrible her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else anybody else the director mike was a confusing character he seemed to have a purpose for being there but it didnt seem like his death was necessary the acting for this role was good nothing great but better than salemsthe plot was real lousy if you think about it stanley who is presumed dead makes his way onto the set of cabin by the lake the movie based on his script he stumbles upon the director and in a short time the director is dead and stanley is running the show yeah out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him theres some killings not a whole lot and the ones that are shown are ridiculous one of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene another character gets chewed up by a motorboat and one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning these writers must have been hard up for excitementi just have to say that i was not impressed with the filming of the movie the way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast also the new cabin by the lake was poorly created we arent shown it but only in a few scenes and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless it worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more but it didnt work in this onethere were too many characters in this sequel all of them except for a few had no reason to be there the acting of what little is showed was really bad andthey just didnt have a purpose in this movieall in all return to cabin by the lake is a sequel picking up from where the first left off cabin by the lake i can take but this was just not impressive judd nelson should have avoided this one and so should you its nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second not to mention that the writing was horrible put this on only if you need some help getting to sleepso we see that stanley defies death and is still alive and well by the way he talks it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself quit throwing in sequels and we may be alrightdid the film makers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first one they were all done in a tank never never reveal the secrets of filming,neutral
211,a decent sequel but does not pack the punch of the original a murderous screenwriterjudd nelsonassumes new identities in order to direct his own novel cabin by the lake still ruthless killing but movie seems very tongueincheek any humor is not of the funny kind total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times nelson is way over the top this movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screenthis should have happened to this script,positive
212,return to cabin by the lake does not in any way stand up to the original with only one main character stanley returning for the sequal the film is not even worth the hours of your time i am a huge fan of the first film the story line and acting was really good but this is one movie that i will never again watch it is basically equal to what the sequals to urban legends and blair witch were like but with much worse acting ive personally seen better acting in soap operas it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh i in no way recommend this movie to anyone watching it will just detract from the first,positive

214,viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence now that is funny would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle but trust me folks this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see and if youre not laughing at it five minutes in id say youve lost your sense of humordavid niven plays a doomed and bravadobesotted raf pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable female air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love just as hes plunging to his certain and fiery death isnt it romantic of course hes spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance and washes up on the beach just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle they immediately clinchlooking past the bizarre homoerotic subtexts so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts from a naked boy sitting barebutted in the sand playing the movies twilightzoneesquire theme on his little flute to a celestial courier so campyqueeny his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love we get itfly boys like girls in skirts and heels and girls like em back and apparently all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get stars on imdbas for the quality of the production the continuityediting is poor enough to induce cringing and the lighting is perhaps even worse than that but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad there are games played with technicolor whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that and foreshadowing so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the docs motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck and freezemotion which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camerathe best shots are the early ones on the beach but after that its all downhill the moving like an escalator is moving staircase is hardly the odessa steps to say the least and id really caution anyone from feeling like theyd have to see this lame attempt at moviemaking on their account the movie overall is bad enough to be funny and thats about the best thing i can say for it,neutral
215,i saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from nyc after minutes i said to him youve got to be kidding is this some sort of joke he thought it was good i told him that i thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made what was it supposed to be i asked a propaganda movie made for children the plot is stupid the acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life love or even afterlife of which it offers an incredibly idiotic viewneed some psychiatric help please if someone tries to get you to stick this in your dvd or video player consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computerit wont destroy your player but it will destroy your evening if they had made razzies in the s this would have won in every category ps it also goes under the dubious sobriquet of stairway to heaven,neutral
216,despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential set as a prequel to the original star trek series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer rick berman who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a star trek series could be which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint the actual showrunner brannon braga didnt help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchises internal mythology it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck never have i seen a series that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors jolene blaylock exceptedlast so long it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience even a trekker audience is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires unfortunately it appears as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that enterprise suffered from franchise fatigue and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they the audience will comesimply put in a teevee universe where we are given shows like battlestar galactica and the shield the powersthatbe must give the viewing public a star trek that measures up and is dramatically competitive it is just that straightforward and easy,neutral

219,while its early to say how the series will evolve i can say that the pilot was less than i thought it would be there is still potential for the series however of course when i first saw voyager i thought it had potential too but was sorely disappointed my gut tells me enterprise wont be as bad as voyager howeveras for the impressions of the pilotthe pilot had some good ideas and good themes i liked the introduction the shows opening credits were interesting with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song scott bakula is excellent in the role of captainwhere it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the feel of setting out on a grand adventure the plot of the episode itself was more a generic trek story with the themes of exploration and first step towards space merely subplot and subtext were you to edit out the references to this being the first deep space mission the plot would be hard to differentiate between the eras of enterprise tos or tng the central plot didnt reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series the plot of launching the first mission would have been grand enough without the action instead of isolated references to the newness of exploration they could have been the story get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it oh for a tv show that once again would make us think make us feel the excitement of the wind and being on the sea instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay there was way too much gunplaywe had the feeling more that humans were the freshmen in an established school new kids on the block as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe sadly the klingons landed on our doorstep instead of us finding them that meeting could have been far more historic and far more sociological just how do two such different societies interact dont just hint about it show iti had to think of it more as trek with an akward crew and limited technology as opposed to the first brave steps into the unknown i wanted to see something newer and fresher the series promises to have a new concept but so far i havent seen this new great concepti will conclude with reiterating the sentiment that the series has potential there are some interesting characters bakula is wonderful blalock has potential the overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw kirk in a world before apollo if only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme we will have a show which will create new legendsyou shoot an arrow into the air good luck capt archerto the producers take more risks and make us think,positive
220,im not a huge star trek fan but i was looking forward to this i was intrigued by the prehype descriptions of the enterprise its crampedsubmarine styling and roughedged technology compared to the treks we are used toi didnt see anything all that interesting in this pilot i found the plot to be convoluted and confusingi will admit that i did like some of the character development the depictions of the humans as an adolescent species ready to outgrow their britches was entertainingand that vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rackbut i dont think im going to get hooked on this series,positive
221,the earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite although turturro is an actor i generally like his luzhin often resembled a bad rain man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semiautistic man was annoying overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances,negative
222,a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing the movie twists and turns through miriad plot surprises at a desperate attempt to kep the audience guessing offcourse puncturing the plot with steamy scenes they thought would help it alongjames belushi is involved in this pseudointellectual attempt and just sleep walks through the movie the same applies for the other actors the plot is quite silly and tacky whih in itelf is not such a crime but towards the end the tremendous plottwists get very tiresome and boringhowever the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day but dont fret if you miss this onea rather lame,negative
223,if you can imagine mickey mouse as a new york street pimp or john wayne as a communist spy then you might believe pat boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncles farm in kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this moviethis film is so stupid that it isnt even campy for a mid s sexless love story and the problem is that hollywood made such a big deal about pat boones refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he wont kiss shirley jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the screen consummation of their love its sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys dont have gunsthe story is pointless even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasmapril love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with ishtar and plan from outer space,neutral
224,i really wanted to like this western being a fan of the genre and a fan of buffalo bill wild bill hickok and calamity jane all of whom are in this story add to the mix gary cooper as the lead actor and it sounded great the trouble wasit wasnt i found myself looking at my watch just minutes into this being bored to death jean arthurs character was somewhat annoying and james ellison just did not look like nor act like buffalo bill cooper wasnt at his best either sounding too wooden this was several years before he hit his prime as an actorin a nutshell his western shot blanks head up the pass and watch another oater because most of em were far better than this one,positive
225,i have always admired susan sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor i therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts her characters rescue from the south pole was done by a canadian charter company from edmonton alberta flying a canadian designed and built twin otter aircraft the trip had been turned down by the us airforce navy and coast guard as beyond their capabilities the same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the south pole base i feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task i fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a usaf hercules,neutral
226,warning spoilers following superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place other than that libelous scandalous filmed in canada presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is and starring susan sarandon of all people i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary kenn borek air,neutral
227,ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the s i was shocked to find out it was released in secondly the plot was all over the place right off the bat the story is confusing had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story wouldve been better also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much it was bizarre and badly filmed the scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand i love chinese epic films but if youre looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise visually stunning the plot is interesting and good character development not this film beware you will be disappointed,neutral
228,zu warriors most definitely shouldve been an animated series because as a movie its like watching an old anime on acidthe movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or somethingwhether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical god demonwizard thingthe plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this moviethe plot soon follows this chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flyingprincess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed uwe boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or somethingeven the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but im going to say they are blurry and acid trip like yes thats a wordi watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understandwho am i kidding i didnt understand it at allit felt like i was watching episode of some s anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of at number because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire timei can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching inuyasha at episode drunkyeah thats right you dont know what the hell is going ondont waste your brain trying to figure this out,negative
229,this is not so much film as big budget childrens television as far as i can tell the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans this theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as insomnia when its first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia i thought wow a nihilistic martial arts film but no such luck although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old mans long white eyebrows zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off thats not a good sign i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray harryhausen and xena warrior princess primitive,neutral
230,watched this on dvd in original language with english subs either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesnt make much of story and give any character development there are quite a few hk stars in this but the movie doesnt need their presence to make it better or worse its just bad the bright and colorful scenes done in cg are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long if anything this makes me think of a childs movie with its nonstop barrage of cg fight scenes and crap plot im certain i grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy,neutral
231,spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty nobody should love that lucius shepardthe color purple takes place in the deep south during the early s and tells the story of celie and nettie two african american sisters the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather this motif innocence interrupted by men permeates the entire filmthe film then launches into a series of short sequences celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather gives birth in a dirty barn has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly forcing her to cook clean and look after his childrenall these horrific scenes are given little screen time and are instead surrounded by moments of pixiedust cinematography a meddlesome symphonic score incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that the color purple made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes ten minutes he lasted a long timethe film is often said to deal which racism sexism and black culture but this is not true alice walker the author of the novel upon which the film is based claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian her book is a lesbian fantasy a story of female liberation and selfdiscovery which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women for walker the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia black sisterhood and female independence celebratedspielbergs film however reframes walkers story through the lens of comforting american mythologies this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows the cast comprised of lecherous men always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins stereotypical fat mammies jazz bands and gospel choirs this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike readily and happily accepting their social conditions a film in which black people are oversexed carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible albert lives in a huge house and black men are completely inept this is not the old south this is the old south as derived from gone with the wind mgm muscals song of the south warner cartoons halleluha and banned disney movies in other words its the south as seen by a child raised on s tv its all so cartoonish so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracyof course in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed this reconciliation was in walkers novel but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kinbeyond walkers hate letter to black men and spielbergs bizarre caricaturing of black life we are shown nothing of the black community we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community instead spielbergs camera jumps about desperately fighting for our attention one of celies kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a home alone movie every emotion over played the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by couple this with quincy jones ridiculously white music and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith scored by a black man trying to emulate john williamsproblematic too is the lack of white characters consider this the men in this film arent portrayed as being rough to each other nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood no they are cruel by nature and the women whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed rather it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors women unable to support themselves and their children aloneand so theres a hidden ideology at work here late in the film one character tells another that since he didnt respect his wife she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them ie respect one another in your poor minority community and you wont run afoul of the dominant white culture a failure to confront sex and lesbianism inappropriate musical numbers countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz incongruous comic business emphatic music cues and wildly hyped emotionality all contribute to rendering the color purple worthless,neutral
232,you may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilersim sorry but spielberg didnt deserve to win any oscar for this piece and i think the academy was right in that vote other oscars for best actor nominations and such that i dont know about but it would be hard to justify given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product the way spielberg directs this is so contrived so meddlesome while watching this movie a distinction made during a film as art course i have taken was screaming at me sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered sentimentality is sugary and unreal a false view of life this is overthetop sentimentality when in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity as celie and shug avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from nettie they have found there are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film all the men crowding around miss millies car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings hes working on a cheap slapstick gag the whole troop of revelers heading from the jook joint en masse to the chapel as if magically entranced by the choirs singing on and on nothing rings true i even wondered if harpos name was chosen purposefully because its his wife sophias real name oprah backwards spielberg isnt above such cutenessits not that spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion schindlers list was amazing deeply touching for me and i greatly admire saving private ryan too for its realism even if the story is a bit contrived,positive
233,this is really terriblethe only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie i have ever watched i would have a suitable replyi think it is filmed on mm so it is already tacky like hell i wouldnt have bothered commenting but i noticed some fanboys probably connected to the movie had claimed that this was the best movie since the matrix let me debunk the myths and liesthere is nothing good in the movie everything yells tacky the actress is ugly the fight choreography is the worst i have ever seen the fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldnt hurt a kitten obviously the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the moviei know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before unforgivable,neutral
234,dude really where have you guys been the past years this is shocking in all kind of ways horror this is a joke there is nothing wrong with being low budget but this is a laugh if you want to look at the classics freaks of tod browning the victims of dracula and frankenstein the undying monster ernest thesiger paul wegeners the golem and the passengers of the ghost train you cant compare it it gives it a bad name bad acting bad screenplay etc total waist of money and free time have watched a lot of movies were as horror is my all time favorite i really am speechless have nothing more to say that please dont do the effort to watch something so daft please understand,neutral
235,well you know the rest this has to be the worst movie ive seen in a long long time i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this rolethe lead role is played by to me a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkeybruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early s and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts however even this cant disguise the fact that the lady doesnt know how to throw a punch an average year old boy would take her apart on this showingsorry the only mystery on show here is how this didnt win the golden raspberry for its year,neutral
236,im in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies we also have access to plenty of pirated movies this gem came along with other movies and this is easily the worst ive seen in a long time ive seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesnt take itself too seriously but really i think thats a cover up for the fact that its horrible its not tongue in cheek the writers really thought they were improving on the movie blade this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin which if you havent seen i recommend at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that youll laugh harder than you thought possible this is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever from the bad acting to clich visual ie opening credits to the adobe premier special effects they couldnt even get blanks for the guns which may have to do with where the movie was filmed but if youre going to use effects make them close to accurate as for the cast it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out once again like ron hall in vampire assassin dont let stunt folk act they cant also the comment about this being a return of old vampire moviesno its not this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about buffy the vampire slayer blade underworld theyre all about some super star fighting the vampires this is the newest vampire genre with bad blood fake screams and cheesy over acting obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie or friends of the cast but what do i care i paid cents for it anyway to wrap this up someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie i give them credit because its better than i could do of course i also know i cant make movies so i dont try i do know how to watch movies though i work hour nights days a week ive seen several thousand in the year ive been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack,neutral
237,valentine is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list think halloween friday the th scream and i know what you did last summer it certainly isnt as good as those movies that i have listed about but its better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first friday the th film one of those films was the canadian made my bloody valentine which i hated alot valentine is a better film than that one but its not saying much the plot a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up then theyre picked off onebyone the killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge but is it him or could it be somebody else valentine has an attractive cast which includes denise richards david boreanaz marley shelton jessica capshaw and katherine heigl they do what they can with the material theyve got but a lackluster script doesnt really do them any justice there are some scary moments throughout however out of four,positive
238,theres one line that makes it worth to rent for angel fans everyone else this is just a very bad horror flick the female characters are typical horror movies females they are wooden annoying and dumb you are glad when they are killed off long live the strong female character in a horror movie,neutral
239,there are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad valentine that i dont know where to begin i will say this though here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school you know the ones with batman exclaiming youre a super crimefighting valentinevalentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of scream the villain is omniscient and nighinvulnerable the heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming heyijustleftmycoatbehind the score is more overbearing than norman bates motherthe flimsy plot follows several childhood friends now grown up and extremely curvaceous since the film gives them nothing else to do they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one this stalker appears to be former nerd jeremy melton who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school with valentines day approaching the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom melton seems like the obvious suspect only problem is as numerous characters warns in thirteen years melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome so insert terrified gasp here everyone is a suspectheres problem one in order to have any sense of suspense while watching valentine you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming david boreanaz nerds dont turn into angel when they grown up they turn into older balder nerds hes not a terrible actor but the script by no less than four writers gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out denise richards the bustiest actress in hollywood never to star in baywatch is especially exploited most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene note to self always bring a bathing suit to a valentines day party just because its february doesnt mean you might not feel like taking a little dipthe slasher in valentine dresses in headtotoe black with a cherubs mask heres problem number two the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone whos whacking people in the face with hot irons plain and simple its not instead it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face including his eyes and ears can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables then again given the things the cupid killer does maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands not only is the movie bad it isnt even sure who the killer is the final twist is more huh than hah when youre not scratching your head youre yawning then groaning then searching for the nearest exit do not watch this movie even if youre alone on valentines day find something anything else to do youll be glad you did,neutral
240,there is no way to describe how really really really bad this movie is its a shame that i actually sat through this movie this very tiresome and predictable movie whats wrong with it acting there is not one performance that is even remotely close to even being subpar atleast they are all very pretty soundtrack songs if we get orgy on the soundtrack then everyone will know that they are watching a horror film soundtrack score okay but anyone with a keyboard can make an okay soundtrack these days dont even get me started on the what the hell moments here are a few killer can move at the speed of lightdoor opens actress turns no one is there turns back there is something sitting in front of her out of now where the killer shows up with a power drill a really big one the filmmakers get points for at least plugging it in but can i really believe that the killer took the time to find the power outlet to plug it in i feel like one of the guards at the beginning of holy grail and want to say whered you get the power drill i could go on and on about how bad this film is but i only have words i will give this out of ten stars one star for making me laugh and another star for all the cleavage seriously do not waste your time with this one,neutral
241,in an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like scary movie and shriek if you know what i did last friday the th valentine fails why did people like halloween because it was original new and went beyond anything thats ever been done why did they like scream because at least it made sense valentine is just a stupid slasherflick that has hardly any gore what soever the plot is so similar to halloween and urban legend its not funny and the moment the killer comes on screen you know who it is its just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable the teen slasher genre is dead get over it out of,negative
242,firstly there are some good things about this film but its all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie in the advertising of this movie that ive seen a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it but shes a poor actress and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be not that that has anything to do with the movie and whats with that look she gives everyone perhaps its part of the character but like i said the acting still the writing is fine you know who it is all throughout the movie and you can almost predict what is about to happen but not in an irritating way i think the book its based on is probably good judging by the plot line but next time ill read the book to find out rather than watch this,positive
243,this stalk and slash turkey manages to bring nothing new to an increasingly stale genre a masked killer stalks young pert girls and slaughters them in a variety of gruesome ways none of which are particularly inventiveits not scary its not clever and its not funny so what was the point of it,negative
244,valentine is a horrible movie this is what i thought of itacting very bad katherine heigl can not act the others werent much betterstory the story was okay but it could have been more developed this movie had the potential to be a great movie but it failedmusic yes some of the music was pretty cooloriginality not very original the name paige prescott recognize prescottbottom line dont see valentine its a really stupid movie,neutral
245,this movie was rented by a friend her choice is normally good i read the cover first and was expecting a good movie although itwas a horror movie which i dont prefer but no horror came to mind while watching the movie it was a dullnot very entertaining movie the appearance of denise richardswas again a pleasure for the eye but thats it we the four of uswere a little bit disappointed but feel free to see this movie andjudge it yourself,positive
246,the good i liked this movie because it was the first horror movie ive seen in a long time that actually scared me the acting wasnt too bad and the cupid killer was believable and disturbingthe bad the story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak there just wasnt much to it the ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting i do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle goreoverall a good scare but a bad story out of,negative
247,its plain to see why the makers of scary movie found it so easy to spoof these teen slasher movies they are so unbelievably formulaic and if valentine had been released a year or so earlier im sure they would have been spoofing this film too thats if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the screams i know what you did last summers and urban legendsvalentine offers nothing new to this genre except a better than usual ending which of course leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel as always a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women killing the main characters friends one by one in typically over the top style lots of ta on display no character development bad acting and overly elaborate bloodshedthe thing i cant stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as who done its the thing is that they arent because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked and tells the main character whos friends have now all been murdered usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway eg main characters mothers uncles fishing partner kicked his friends fathers dog everybody still left alive throughout the film is a suspect but they are more red herrings than suspects as we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealedvalentine followed this formula almost to the letter spoiler mini spoiler anyway in valentine the motive was not revealed but more left for you to think about given that the film didnt quite conclude in the typical teen slash way the issue is only part resolved and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody will the killer want more or were the demons truly vanquishedthis still didnt make valentine a good film instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual which still doesnt count for much to anybody thinking of making another film along these lines please dont originality is so important and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre,neutral
248,spoilers spoilers are all teen slasher flicks suffering from a drought of originality it awfully seems so first of all this is a noble premise that couldve been utilized well a rejected young nerd who grows up stalks and murders all the girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in junior high cant say you had nothing to work with but this film goes through the same motions as all the other recent slashers everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will strike we know the pattern by now these stupid slasher movies push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute let me ask you something who in their right mind is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while shes all alone and surrounded by corpses does that make any damn sense at allvalentine is only occasionally innovative one good shot involves the butchering of denise richards character she gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes at her with a chainsaw theres some good songs in the soundtrack including one cool track by orgy the music video is contained in the special features section on the dvdeven the acting is mediocre at best the actors all sleep through their roles of course david boreanaz is often stoic even in his portrayal as the title character on angel denise richards is a fine actress though and she keeps a stoneface throughout the movievalentine is just like youd expect pretentious implausible forgettable cheesy and without a good scare in sight dont even bothermy score out of,neutral
249,here was no effort put into valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film a subgenre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so ive heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie and as much as i hate to be redundant the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything the punch bowl over poor jeremys head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie hey everyone this is the director and the following is my carrieripoff scene enjoy but thats just a suggestionspoilers the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning she gets killed people wonder in the old ohbutthatstuffonlyhappenstootherpeople tone and then they start to get killed the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful but they have no idea how to do it take jason for example here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated he is assumed to carry some significance besides that and more importantly he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious valentines day cards it is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects and jason is a perfect example of the effort but not such a good example of a successful effort sure i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer but thats not the point we know from early on that he is terrible with women which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film but then in the middle of the film he appears at a party smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls and then gives them a hateful look and walks away disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation we already know he is a cardboard character but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with himon the positive side the killers true identity was in fact made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also unfortunately yet another ripoff early in the film when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel he makes no sound suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female rather than a male as everyone suspects but then for the rest of the film we just have this stolid relentless unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife director jamie blanks who with all due respect looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade mentions being influenced by halloween this is of course completely unnecessary because its so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael meyers is that michaels mask was so much more effective and he didnt have a problem with nosebleeds this stuff is shameless at the end there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is complete with slow and drawn out andthekilleris mask removal but then we see adams nose start to bleed as he holds kate his often reluctant girlfriend and we know that hes been the killer all along nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film valentine is not scary i watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember and even i wasnt scared and the characters might be possible to care about if it werent so obvious that they were just going to die i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews although the film was in and out of the theaters faster than battlefield earth but the end result is the same old thing,neutral
250,this movie in away was superclever its theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made valentine makes zero attempt to be original what is valentine anyway its a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier there is nothing original in valentine i only saw it once and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off prom night carrie scream any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebodyi know there is more but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldnt grab them as fast as they camevalentine had no chance of being a good movie how come every horror movie has to have a suprise killer people you dont care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene one minute a nice girl turns into an evil bch then shes an insecure woman and so on and son onnormally any horror movie in my book can be saved by gore once again valentine doesnt have this it was as if they tried to make it pg but failed so they left the edit do not see this overlyinspired ripoff unless you hate yourself and you want to die jleonard rollins,neutral
251,well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie i mean havent we had enough of this yet scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious the plot sucks and the acting is the worst ive seen only godzilla can compare which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst ive seen in the cinema with this onethere is so many plot holes in the story and the girls are so alike that you dont even now who has been killed and who has not and you dont care the only of them i knew in advance was denise and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a moviestay as far away from this movie as possible,negative
252,in tobias schneerbaum disappeared in the peruvian amazon one year later he walked out of the junglenaked it took him years to go back supposedly keep the river on your right is a modern cannibal tale in reality anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed the first half of the movie is more like a travel log of new ginuea mostly touting the native art the second half relies on still photos of a peruvian cannibal tribe but really thats about it unless of course you are interested in home movies of a jewish wedding or schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers i give up big disappointment and not really a modern cannibal tale merk,neutral
253,so where are the cannibals those intrigued by the title and the real cannibal appeal of this film will be let down instead we are shown a strange man and his revisiting of a papua new guinea village full of natives one of whom was his lover several decades prior the man tobias schneebaum is new york jewish as they come and somehow this is intertwined with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenesthere are no real cannibals here only stories relayed by some of the natives and by tobias himself not all together a bad film very interesting and great cinematography schneebaum remains highly likable throughout and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life that is about as far removed from western civilization as one can getits just not what it claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary out of kids,positive
254,well where to begin i guess i can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed call me ignorant for not knowing of schneebaums book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that i have been living under some kind of a rock but dont blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this documentary is actually a companion to said book yeah i felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why i sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a modern cannibal tale i mean am i a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes i certainly didnt expect an hour and fortyfive minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life i certainly didnt expect the insipid directing and i most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at tobias schneebaum and all of his offputting gloryschneebaum is indeed unlikable the old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isnt even that interesting a character to fill a story oh really he was a cannibal ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding schneebaums dirty past the only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in peru and say that he had a small piece thats it folks ninety minutes of bull later and tobias schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches its like calling a movie the life of a true don juan only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played just the tip unbelievablethe directing is indeed superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told alright i understand that i didnt read schneebaums volume before watching his celluloid tale of it but i can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing one minute schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next hes going on and on about how he cant drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life i mean jesus can you at least slam his back story to the first part follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to peru also i dont particularly care much for schneebaums insipid little quips on life and living but i at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings if i hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle i dont expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later absurdanother note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared while some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reelsthe bottom line here is that tobias schneebaum is a fraud pure and simple i know that i havent read the book but im still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own this documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of schneebaums work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a dvd schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably unriveting if youre looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism turn away because keep the river to your right is an embarrassingly hilarious selfserving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straightjacket and a gag,neutral
255,i am curious is really two films in one half of it is the sexual experimental side of lena and the other half is her curiosity with politicalsocialism whatever the directors intention the two dont really mesh together the director should have just stuck with the romantic side of lena and made a separate movie for the politics there is a bizarre mixture of politicalwar rallies dr king serious political interviews flopping breasts and pubic hair the film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie other than the interesting sex scenes youll be bored dry watching this film unlike many other reviewers i think the nudesexual scenes are overdone for what it is if you want to see real porn im sure there are better choices the pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is i think the cast did a fine job however they played their parts believably there is little of the overthetopness im so used to seeing in the american films during this time,positive
256,this film once sensational for its forwardthinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity it seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries given how socialistic sweden eventually became the radicalism of its politics once controversial appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later and its sex scenes at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials look pretty tame in a modern context nevertheless the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of s youth rebellion one part of the film that still holds up its selfconsciousness with respect to the fourth wall every once in a while the filmmakers film themselves making the film the satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle,neutral
257,the plot line of no one sleeps is not a bad idea and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest but throughout watching this film we were saying aloud these filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations the lighting is good makeup and hair are goodwhy is the sound so bad throughout the film the sound was echoy garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligiblethere is some good acting in this film and i think jim thalman is really a good actor this story with some of the same actors would have been worth doing as a highbudget filmi just cant reiterate enough if you have a limited budget dedicate more to good sound sound is as much a part of a film as the image and its worth doing right couldve earned a,positive

259,this movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star power sentimentality and love triangle of emotions what really bothered me about this movie was the makers absurd notion of surrogate mother a whore who conceives a child with someone after have sex with the man of the family desiring a child is not a surrogate mother neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother i have seen indian movies and television shows that made to years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently the whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible i realize that most bollywood movies arent meant to be plausible but they dont pretend to be either this movie wants us to emote along with the characters but this cant done with such a ridiculous contrived conflict i would have expected better from abbas and mustan,positive
260,i wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie its a big joke good its entertaining you get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film i wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted topriety a pros plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple salmanrani who want a child but cant i wonder how it would be if this drama was a reallife takeoff from a real couples liferani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her salman she cares for priety and tries pushing her husband salman to preity so they may have some romance when will the audience get fed up of salmans nakhrasthough a good pasttime this movie is unbearable absurd,positive
261,the tv guide calls this movie a mystery what is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents this is bollywood at its bestworst i honestly cannot tell the difference nauseatingly sweet kitschy clichs on every level storyline situations dialog music and choreography to put it bluntly you must be a retard to enjoy it i watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity but there were times when i had to walk away from it because i could not take it any more the only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses,positive
262,but the keyword here is usually i have been known to adore movies everyone thinks are dumb but in the world of brated movies this one is zrated absolutely ridiculous the thing i respect about most of my favorite brated movies are that they dont take themselves too seriously the makers of movies like that sortof treat the movie lightly even if its a heavy topic i get the impression however that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously like they were putting together a star classic complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots nevertheless despite all this i still gave it out of stars as i am biased towards movies like this if youre a brated fan however i would try too hard to find this one,neutral

265,two years ago on berlin film festival we watched the amos kollek movie sue in the panorama program with a wonderful anna thomson in the leading part its a film about loneliness and sex and how the one thing is compensated by the other in the same section on the festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of sue extension du domaine de la lutte which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having no sex is one and the same problem but unfortunately we cant sympathize with our hero how he is called by the storyteller because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself own fault im sorry i cant understand him not enough the writerdirectoractor want us admitting to him that its not his destroyed selfconsciousness or the passivity of his personality what brought him so far but the rotten society and its image of sexuality yes there are some deeper insights about gender relations but we wont follow him so far and the point is that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate having no sex who didnt notice yet its a quite depressing filmin the beginning there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation at the bed store the hero speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed perhaps its too broad getting up the stairs you have to stay at home half a day this is a satire about a character who doesnt know taking the life and heart in hands doing something the movie doesnt follow this path but handles his characters with helplessness nobody believes that our hero is able to instigate tisserand for a murder too dull too kind too passive not to mention tisserands complex he has an inhibition but he couldnt be of course a murderer of women to finish there are women and the world its not a device of a modern sexualized society help you as you can but dont follow the messages and the wisdom of this movie which announces bankruptcy to human relationships without seizing the real conflicts within,neutral
266,blank check is one of those kids movies that could have been a great suspense thriller for the kids but instead its a tired lame home alone ripoff that isnt worth a dime quigley is a criminal who just escaped from jail and gets his hidden million dollars from a big score and then we meet preston a frustrated kid whose room is taken over by his brothers to start a business and obviously dad treats his brothers better because they make money the same day he goes to a kids birthday party and since his dad is a cheapo he goes on little kids rides while the other kids go on roller coasters then he receives a birthday card and a check of bucks how cheap is this family so he goes to the bank to open an account and meets the gorgeous shea stanley were her parents mets fans he finds out he needs to open a account meanwhile quigley gives his million to his banker friend and finds out the bills are marked so he will send a lackey named juice to get the unmarked ones when preston leaves his bike gets run over by quigley hes about to write a check when he spots the cops and bolts back home his parents scolded him about his busted up bike and gets grounded what their kid got almost run over and they worried about a bike so preston forges a million dollar check via his computer and comes back only to be escorted to the banker thinking that hes juice he gives preston the money but the real juice came and realized they been duped by a kid so preston buys a mansion under the name macintosh gets a limo driver who says unfunny jokes and goes on a epic shopping spree then he spots shea and talks about opening his account kid youre loaded and youre talking about opening an account we soon realized shea is actually an fbi agent tracking down quigley and his two other accomplices then he told his cheapy dad hes got a job working for mr macintosh and spends the day riding go karts playng vr games and hanging out with his limo driver buddy then he goes out on a date with shea in a fancy restaurant what a year old wining and dining a something fbi agent afterwards he takes her to a street geyser and playing around in the water messing up sheas dollar dress yet she takes it well if this was a bit realistic she would slap him for messing up her expensive dress so quigley and the others still mad interrogates a little kid and quickly spills the beans and preston is being chased by quigley in a scene taken from the original script and afterwords he is hosting mr macintoshs birthday which is really his birthday when he discovers he couldnt pay for the party he sits in his chair and dad talks to macintosh which he doesnt know its his son hes talking to and talks about preston should be a real kid and has his whole childhood ahead of him and wants preston to go home early what an hour ago you were grilling him about his finances so preston asks everyone to leave and sits alone pondering when quigley and the others break in to the house to make preston pay and so he faces then in a finale that rips off home alone quigley gets spun around in a ball while preston is driving a go kart juice gets hit in the groin and more antics ensue until the trio get preston cornered and when it seem all hope is lost shea and a bunch of swat guys come to save the day and so quigley and his crew get sent to jail but is there any hope for preston and shea there is and she kisses him in the lips what what what a grown woman kissed a kid in the lips come on is she mentally disabled i mean an fbi agent who knows the countrys laws would risk her career to kiss a kid she could get arrested on the spot and the most creepiest part of all is that isnt goodbye and shell see him in or years oh dear and so he comes home to his family celebrating his birthday so the moral of the story is love and respect can be bought what are they smoking the bottom line is that is a waste of time the morals are whacked its flat as a tortilla the kid is annoying the villains are lame the comic relief isnt funny the brothers are unlikable the dad is even worse the romantic subplot is creepy the plots shallow and the only saving grace is the cinematography from bill pope which went on to shoot the matrix trilogy and two of the spiderman films so people dont waste your money and go watch home alone instead this has been a samuel franco review,neutral

281,ive seen my fair share of badly thoughtout endings and final twists to films but i dont recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one didthe film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would surprise us all and it did but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped i was left feeling surprised that connery harris fishburn and capshaw had anything to do with this turkey individually or collectivelythe film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall but once the twist was revealed the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable the underlying motive for revenge was illconceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously farfetched whats worse is that once the twist was revealed the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictableharris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he never gives a bad performance even if the movie aint that great so all in all it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested the last minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema,positive
282,paul armstrong is a liberal scottishborn professor of law at harvard known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty who is hired to take on the case of bobby earl a young black man from florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of joanie shriver an eleven year old white girl earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is blair sullivan a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders armstrong visits sullivan in his cell on death row hoping to persuade him to confess to joanies murder thereby saving earl from the electric chair at first all goes well sullivan confesses and earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction as this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer warning major plot twist ahead and so it proves the anticipated twist soon materialises earl it transpires is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted and probably of several others as well but hatched a diabolical plan together with sullivan in order to secure his freedom sullivan will confess to joanies murder if earl will murder his parents just why sullivan wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved earl has a grudge against armstrongs wife herself a lawyer who acted as counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when earl was accused of rape just cause is an example of the autocannibalism in which hollywood sometimes likes to indulge cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others the first half owes an obvious debt to films like intruder in the dust and to kill a mockingbird about the only difference is that the sheriff who beats a confession out of bobby earl is himself black whereas in earlier films he would have been white police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity the central twist in the plot was borrowed from costagavrass music box although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end the finale in which a lawyer his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of cape fear which also take place in the swamplands of the american south ed harris characterisation of sullivan as a biblequoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of robert de niros character in the scorsese version of cape fear made four years before just cause there is a postscript just as just cause borrowed heavily from several other movies seven years later its central plot twist was in its turn to be blatantly plagiarised in the ashley judd vehicle high crimes the trouble with this style of filmmakingbynumbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them the whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts and just cause is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de niro playing max cady blair underwood is ok as bobby earl the supposedly innocent young man of the early scenes but unconvincing as bobby earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones sean connery as armstrong and laurence fishburne as the black sheriff are rather better but neither is good enough to save the film connery and harris were to act together in another better film the rock the following year there is another problem with just cause the first half of the film looks like a standard liberal issue movie antideath penalty antiracist and critical of heavyhanded policing the second half looks more like the work of a diehard reactionary preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes the filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the presumably unwanted effect of reversing its political stance or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it a suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency,neutral
283,just cause showcases sean connery as a harvard law prof kate capshaw does she still get work as his wife slight age difference and lawrence fishburne as a racist southern cop and ed harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killerweird casting but the movie plays serious mindf with the audience dont read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers first of all i felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the liberal stereotypes the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence the coroner witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl because he is blackconnery is a harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty he is approached by the convicted mans grandmother to defend him and reopen the trialconnery is stonewalled yawn by the small town officials and the good il boys club but finds that the case against blair the alleged killer now on death row was all fabricated the main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of himthe beating was administered by a black cop who even played russian roulette to get the confession out of him connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting hannibal lecterlike ed harris he finds out where harris hid the murder weaponhe gets a retrial and blair is freedi think film overthen suddenly it turns out that blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used white guilt to enlist connery he concocted the story with ed harris in return for blair carrying out a few murders for harrisnow blair is on the loose again thanks to connerys deluded pc principles the final min are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama connery and fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts yes you read that right in the evergladesthat was one weird filmso the whole system is corrupt and inefficient the cops are all just bullies and abu graib type torturers but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to frytruly depressing on every level the system is completely rotten and the pc white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded tootwo thumbs down connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something,neutral
284,the form of the film is that of a suspense shocker there are surprises twists and turns reverses and excitements at times this is truly an edgeoftheseat film but it disappoints and disappoints severelythe villain of the piece is not believeable his character does not hold together i refuse to spoil the film but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the endthe second major disappointment of the film is thatfinally it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film there is little qualitative difference between this and one of the friday the th films not that every film need always be totally tasteful but this film does drip gore on occasionthough the film features the magnificent sean connery even he does not measure up to his usual standard and often just seems to be walking through the paces,neutral
285,just cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from ed harris then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until youve got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet sean connerys wife a typically mannered and unconvincing kate capshaw and kid a very young scarlet johannsen in an alligator skinners shack the kind of movie thats probably best seen on a plane and even then only once,positive
286,look carefully at the wonderful assortment of talent put together to make this movie connery fishburne capshaw harris underwood beatty thigpen even cameos by slezak lange and plimpton they prove in spades the adage that a good cast cannot save a bad script the story line requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its implausibility should have exceeded even hollywood standards its not particularly original and the twists are downright cruel,neutral
287,as other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last hour however before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by kate capshaw who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene shes in connery is fine as is fishbourne but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality and the ending is simply bizarre the film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have thanksgiving dinner so to compensate they added an overloud dramatic score every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration to the point where it becomes laughable if you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see otherwise skip it,neutral
288,seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie and so i sat down for minutes of unbelief beside ed harris noone seems to own the skills of acting even sean connery who i normally worship must have had an offday during the entire filming of just case not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince methis made this movie look cheap and unrealthe story makes up a little it is thrilling and the plot is unexpectedconclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do,positive
289,st watched out of dirarne glimcher mysterythriller with too many ridiculous plot twists despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright underestimates its audience the moviegoing public is not stupid and i hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with we think that this movie is going to be about something with connerys conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard contrived for the audiences sake run of the mill lets never get it over with thriller we are pulled into every silly switch in character as they are portrayed to us when its needed in the story and were ready for this thing to be over way before it ends yes there is some good acting here especially from blair underwood fishburne and ed harris in a psychosupporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very longawaited end,positive
290,the performances of fishbourne who appears strangely funny somehow and short featureded harris are remarkable unlike connerys who doesnt appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a yr old man in fact the screenplay doesnt make sense imagine a min happy endingplot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters its more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screenwrights schools the more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets the capital punishment is not an issue here although it is a subject from the beginning it sort of fades away without further comment the subjectmatter and environment could have been good,positive
291,a pot boiler if ever i saw one a supposed thriller borrowing from a time to kill silence of the lambs even an inverted in the heat of the night with a little reverse murder a la strangers on a train thrown in it fails abysmally where all the above to a large degree succeeded namely in delivering thrills the plot seems condensed from a bigger book making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving while the direction lacks pace and verve to rein in any kudos a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too connery is clearly slowing down in his old age barely bothering with his attempt at a us accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of hope lange and the father of those gosh darn kids of his he even has a father in law who seems younger than him laurence fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and youre confused from the outset as to whether hes a bad guy or a good guy someone once said that flashbacks shouldnt lie they do confusedly here the rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles the supposed climax managed too to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back not as should have been the aim front edge of my seat mediocre sloppy hollywood film making for sure,neutral
292,this movie is a crappy and forgettable sean connery vehicle the performances are generally crappy especially by capshaw fishburne and the usually solid ed harris connery seems miscast as a harvard academic the movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along it is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels the movie squanders an excellent supporting cast george plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to connery as they debate the death penalty the violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mysterythriller that is manipulation to the highest degree the scripting and direction are extremely poor connerys charisma and screen presence are the films only virtue manipulative violent and ridiculous avoid it,neutral

300,i am guessing the reason this movie did so well at the box office is of course eddie murphy i think this was his first movie since beverly hills cop so at the time he was hot considering that one made over two hundred million and it was r and this one made about million and it was pg does say it was not all that popular i have never been a big eddie murphy fan so that is probably another reason i didnt care for it much at all this one has eddie as some sort of finder of lost kids he must find the golden child or the world is in terrible peril the plot is very bad but as bad as it is it does not compare to the special effects i had seen better stuff done in the s than some of the stuff this one offers ray harryhausen did better stuff still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of eddie unfortunately he is not very funny in this one at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the raiders of the lost ark type scenes i guess they were hoping for a fish out of water effect but to me it just did not work,neutral
301,unlike the adventures of buckaroo banzai or big trouble in little china or conan the barbarian which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and selfdeprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations the golden child is just plain badthe premise itself is not unworkable and there are some funny moments but here the eddy murphy flip attitude just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension the mystic secrets of tibetan buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compelwithout a feeling that anything is at stake or that the characters are faced by real danger why should we carewho should see this film big fans of eddy murphy who cant help themselves i cant think of anyone elseill give this film a out of for the occasional joke that worked,neutral
302,definitely one of funny man eddie murphys lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child three hundred year old dragons and a chosen onemurphy is the chosen one in question and as the opening song suggests he is the best man in the world a finder of lost and missing children he is approached by a mysterious tibetan woman charlotte lewis who tells him he is the chosen one and that it is his destiny to find and rescue the golden child for if the child were to die compassion would die with him as he is the bearer of compassionif all this hocus pocus rubbish hasnt ruined it for you now it surely will once the movie begins suffice to say the plot is abominable and destroys the whole film meant to be another vehicle for murphys egotistical brand of humour the comedy isnt so great mind you the movie fails on many levels even charles dance as the evil sardo numspa cant do much for proceedings very silly and disappointingsunday december tv,neutral
303,well whats to say the golden child falls in the category so bad its good eddie murphy is having some funny and sometimes quite annoying lines but you are still entertained chales dance has never been worse than his role as the villain sardo numspa what a fed up name is thiswho should watch the golden child hm difficult to say but my best guess would be people who likes embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialog out of,neutral
304,why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie burt reynolds peaked then started making dreadful hal needham car chase flicks arnold schwarzenegger became the hottest property in hollywood only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling last action hero and here loquacious eddie murphy erases memories of trading places and hours with this family adventure flick which is an unbelievably tedious childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see charlotte lewiss great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire filmthe story is pure humdrum it concerns social worker murphy contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one chosen for what i hear you ask his job is to rescue a tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world as the main demon classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film but hey im sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents of all murphys films this is easily the worst ive read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role in a non formulaic kind of film and while both points are loosely true theres no forgiving the fact that the film however atypical and non formulaic it might be is an absolute load of garbage,neutral
305,michael jackson would have claimed a spot for the topbilled character in the golden child and because he loves kids that didnt work and why should it so instead we have eddie murphy out to save the world by rescuing kid midas i would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actors inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy adventure comedy thats a step closer to ishtar whatever murphy says or does can be best liked but dont get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent he doesnt belong in this movie and the same went for dr dolittle the violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic and that wouldnt have made any sense as hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy speaking of visuals they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of ronald reagans presidential fame murphy is far better at coming to america and hrs but this stale movie isnt my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste,positive
306,bad movie for sure its such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects a lot of hasty scenes the airport one for example and a real unfunny time charles dance is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in last action hero eddie murphy is doing a noncomic joking and i heard that this sunk had already succeed big time success ill never understand why or how in one tv interview ive heard eddie murphy himself when he was nominated for an oscar regretted it in a comic way one of the comments said heyits the s well no my friend its the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of razzie movies all over the years whether its the s or the s there are reasons made me write about this movie the first is that ill never forget the long tan fascinating legs of charlotte lewis especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house wearing just a blue shirt and oh boy the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be but how odd as ive watched her in following movies and she wasnt that beautiful again anyhow the second reason is that ive found this movies title lately at my list of the worst movies everthe bottom line bad movie greeeeeat legs,negative
307,i remember when the golden child was released in it was universally panned by the critics and im talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of eddie murphy so i guess this movie has something going for itit gets off to a bad start where buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face bad guys enter the templechild sits with blank expressionbad guys chop up the monkschild sits with blank expressionbad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with go on guess you do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at michael jacksons wonderland ranch hed still give the same blank expression this movie would be better titled the wooden childthe title sequence starts and being a movie from the s a pop soundtrack features heavily obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in it seems very dated not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening in fact thats the main problem and boy its a serious one with this movie the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes its like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together i blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be its part fantasy part martial arts part buddy movie part comedy and its all crap,neutral
308,i will start this off by saying i couldnt get all the way through it i picked it up on a rainy day from walmart like the rest of the reviewers on this site i figured there wasnt any way i would regret my purchase was i wrong or what seriously now who approved this project they need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity thats the only fitting punishment i can think of for releasing something this bad the shooting reminds me of the movies i used to make for class projects on a big old vhs cam the acting isnt much better i think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos yay who cares shecky moskowitz is unfunny and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser thats about as much of the plot as i understoodoverall its the worst movie ive ever seen i own it on dvd and have given it to many coworkers to watch each comes back and laughs and says wow i didnt think id ever say i shut off an adam sandler movie minutes inmy response is always well now you can,neutral
309,i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen and yes i have seen cujo adam sandler is an abomination as schecky moskowitz a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner thats the plot thats it nothing else in the film makes sense its all over the place like a mad mans breakfast and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way but more of a frustrating throw both shoes at the tv kind of way even general noriega makes an appearance for no reason i can comprehend it certainly wasnt for humour add to the mix miss australia who has the worst australian accent ive ever heared and you have something which i wont call the worst film ever made because going overboard doesnt even fit the basic definition of a film i highly recomend seeing this film as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see i guarantee the first thing youll say after seeing a bad film will be at least it wasnt as bad as going overboard,negative
310,i wanted to punch the tv watching it was torture i hated it never watch this movie the terrorists are annoying adam sandler is annoying i normally like him but not in this one i wanted to break the dvd this is the most irritating film in the world the comedian hes jealous of is obnoxious the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv do not buy this movie unless you want to annoy someone if you even like adam sandler a little bit dont buy it it will just make you hate him do yourself a favor if you see it in the store hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it its a waste of the i paid for it,negative
311,first i bought it at the video store second i watched it third it was boring fourth it was not funny fifth most of the antics were lame and last but not least its not only a bad movie its a total fiascoi am a huge adam sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film i pity it because it was his first movie even if you are a huge adam sandler fan dont bother watching this movie instead just take the video board a yacht and throw it overboard,neutral
312,i am a huge adam sandler fan and one day i was looking at the castcrew selection on one of his dvds and saw going overboard and decided to go out and rent it so i went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it we put it on and we were shocked to see an adam sandler that didnt hit puberty yet he looks as if he was when this movie came out i couldnt even watch minutes of this crap i didnt laugh chuckle or even smirk at this movie actually the only time i smirked was when i saw how horrid this movie was i could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movieand it didnt work once although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script i realized why i had never heard of this moviebecause it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before this movie in my opinion was the worst movie ever madeever,negative
313,even if youre a huge sandler fan please dont bother with this extremely disappointing comedy i bought this movie for assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man sandler is in it and because i assumed some women would get naked judging by the rrating and scantilyclad women on the cover well there are quite a few scantilyclad women but none get naked im not sure what point this was in sandlers career but im guessing it was even before his snl days i can be wrong this is like watching one of his home movies he might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol timesbut we the audience are left to dry this is hardly a movie sandler does a lot of talking to the camera and even admits at one point that this is nobudget movie thats right not a lowbudget movie a nobudget movie so our job is pretty much to laugh at the quirky characters there is no steady plot its like an extended sketch comedy showbut a crude and badly written one that guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience and sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic henny youngman line take my wife please and the audience is on the floor im not even going to try to make any logic here sure sandlers current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense the penguin in billy madison the midget in happy gilmores happy place but the comedy works this is a strictly amateurish work and even if youre curious about adams early days in filmyou still wont be interested youre better off checking out his start on snl or maybe his underrated role in mixed nuts of course the sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle billy bob thornton also makes a short appearance billy zane titanic has a supporting role and the great burt young from the rocky movies has a significant role this awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the cent rental section of your local video storeand rightfully so my score out of,neutral
314,this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in his characters constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison unfortunately sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent successful and funny manner when this film was made much like his character the majority of the films jokes come from sandler having conversations with himself usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because hes too ugly and cant get women the film is hard to watch too because it doesnt treat itself like a real film sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film often referring to the films low budget or questionable content the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over for fear that if more found out about it it would ruin sandlers career pass this one up at the video store i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time,neutral
315,having decided some time ago to collect the films of billy bob thornton on the strength of class movies like sling blade a simple plan and the man who wasnt there amongst others it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there what i didnt realise however was that there could be one this bad ill give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is the funniest dialogue in it goes like this knock knock whos there the big stinking man the big stinking man who the big stinking man is you yes folks it really is that bad billy bob is only in it for about two minutes i guess he needed the work at that time in his career and the rest of the movie is painful for some reason though although its undeniably awful i dont hate it thats probably because i save my ire for any high budget special effects laden junk like the fast and the furious and not a nobudget flick like this one at a push,negative
316,worst mistake of my lifei picked this movie up at target for because i figured hey its sandler i can get some cheap laughs i was wrong completely wrong midway through the film all three of my friends were asleep and i was still suffering worst plot worst script worst movie i have ever seen i wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour then id stop and you know why because it felt damn good upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burnand that felt better than anything else ive ever done it took american psycho army of darkness and kill bill just to get over that crap i hate you sandler for actually going through with this and ruining a whole day of my life,negative
317,this movie was so bad i couldnt sit through it without doing something else there was no plot and no point i was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian i couldnt recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertainingso how was this made is there no quality control in film watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experienceits hard to imagine that adam sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure he was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy,neutral
318,i saw this movie about years ago and the memory of it still haunts me to this day i was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it so i have only myself to blame but like most i didnt believe all the negativity being a sandler fan it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad i figured it was just sandler haters i couldnt have been more wrongwhat we have here is a comedy that does not contain even second of anything funny that is actually quite an accomplish youd think in a minute comedy they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing but no its just horrible its not so bad its good its just bad you cannot laugh at how bad it is you can only cry you wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle but they never comehave you seen the movie the ring where the people watch a video tape and die days later if this movie was on the video tape people would die instantly by their own hand and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended and that would be the first smile since they pressed playyou might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is unable to curb your curiosity dont please dont trust me im doing you a favor there are types of people in the world those that think going overboard is the worst movie ever made and those that have not yet seen it,neutral
319,shecky is a god damned legend make no mistake until recently i worked for a uk hifi video retail chain running their testing department we would go through many new starters they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores now to tortu test the resolve of these new staff members we would issue them with a copy of going overboard we had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of goodmans dvd player that had this film as a free gift got round to sending their dvd player back they never failed to send shecky back also our new staff would be forced to use only going overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test withnow as to why this film is so bad where do i beginadam sandler who can be so so very funny as in happy gilmore or the wedding singer must have been having one hell of an off day the rest of the crew stank and what is it with billy zane his name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time and he is a decent actor crazy the production quality is absolute zeroi would have been inclined to give this a zero if i could because they didnt even have the guts to call it by its full name the unsinkable shecky moskowitz on release even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far sandler has come and just how low he can go,neutral
320,with adam sandlerthis is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made its about cruise ship waiter shecky sandler wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship first off there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly it is so unfunny its pathetic there is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor but the fword is plentiful the budget is really low and that also ruins the film it takes place on a cruise ship but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for ship extras one of which is billy bob thornton the opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply and it is just pathetic i hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too mins rated r for language,neutral
321,a friend of mine bought this film for and even then it was grossly overpriced despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of hot girlsadam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the ships resident comedian the shamelessly named dickie due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender is presumed lost at sea sandlers character shecker gets his big break dickie is not dead hes rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea sickperhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time,neutral
322,i stole this movie when i was a freshmen in college ive tried to watch it three times the second two because friends wanted to see it sweet adam sandler ive never heard of this movie but since hes so funny its gotta be funny wrong i cant make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing matchinsult war where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain you would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous but after watching this youll know its true this movie isnt worth the price i paid for it ive watched a ton of steven segal movies and ive even watched crossroads twice but i still couldnt watch this,neutral
323,this has to be the worst movie ive ever attempted to watch in the first minutes there wasnt anything to keep my interest in this movie i was on vacation at the time and had plenty of time to devote to a justforthefunofit movie the condo we were staying in had this movie in stock they must have got it from the store or somethingif you like adam sandler this is nothing like any other movie hes made this started with a bad premise and then just got worse theres nothing even remotely funny in itive watched a lot of movies including some i didnt care for but if you decide to waste your time on this movie dont say i didnt warn you,negative
324,this movie is by far the worst movie ever made if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than dont make the damn film i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it id give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie,negative
325,watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of sandler truly a slow and painful deathbought the dvd in the bin at wal mart but the thought that keeps echoing in my head is how can i get my money backthe most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat just does not sinkbest constructive suggestion mystery comedy theatre you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppetmachines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks mystery science theatre immediately spin off a comedy program and feature this flick without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck i fear that viewers may actually begin following sandler with ice picks and chainsaws,neutral
326,i picked up this movie for dollars at a discount book store adam sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie well it wasnt there was absolutely no story line at all bad jokes and the other comedian said the fword every other word he saidcursing usually dosent bother me but this was over the top and even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie it reminded me of dora the explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions and last of all is when they would randomly put in bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie in my opinion dont buy this movie its a waste of money,neutral
327,this is definitely the worst movie adams ever done but at this point in his life he was just happy to have a movie there are or laughs in it but i used the fast forward button through some of it dont waste your time i only saw it because i wanted to see all of his movies but it sucked,neutral
328,if youve ever seen this movie youd know that it if you havent and want to see a classic bad movie i suggest you see this movie because it ranks right down with the worst so if youre really bored go rent it if you want to know what its like heres my little summary adam sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some ms universe models and five other people adam doesnt like how one passenger is getting all the babes and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes but wait it only gets worse youll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is,negative
329,i just finished watching going overboard i have to say that we should send every copy of this film to iraq and make them watch i even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like min adam sandler could not find a better project than this as for the writing if thats what you want to call it those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell i believe that somewhere i read that the budget for this film was and they were way under did wallmart get a good deal on this every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor the only good thing about this movie is you can use the dvd as a coaster or trade it to a friend but then they might not be your friend anymore,neutral
330,i had never heard of this adam sandler movie until i saw it on the wall at blockbuster being an adam sandler fan at the time i rented it honestly i could only watch about mins of it it was terrible do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public i honestly hope this movie goes oop soon and i hope it stays that way,neutral
331,hello i am paul raddick aka panic attack of wtaf channel in philadelphia let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on adam sandlers film career but was digitized after a short timegoing overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and failsor so i thought sandler encounters babes that like history of the world part and rebound the babes were supposed to be engaged but actually they get executed by sawtooth the meanest cannibal the world has ever known adam sandler fared bad in going overboard but fared better in big daddy billy madison and jen leones favorite first dates man drew barrymore was one hot chick spanglish is red hot going overboard aint dooley squat end of file,neutral
332,mere thoughts of going overboard aka babes ahoy make me want to weep throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie its not even a supposed so bad its good movie i would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people cant see it oh the pain the pain,neutral

336,this movie portrays ruth as a womanizing hard drinking gambling overeating sports figure with a little baseball thrown in babe ruths early life was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film also lou gehrig was barely covered and this was a well know relationship good bad or indifferent it should have been covered better than it was his life was more than all bad he was an american hero an icon that a lot of baseball greats patterned their lives after i feel that i am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not his greatness,positive
337,its impossible for me to objectively consider this movie not that i havent tried mind you but i sit down and i pop in the aged vhs and i watch the openingand suddenly im five years old again and clutching my very own care bear and watching the movie with open eyes and an eager hearti can see objectively that this movie is a bizarre combination of cuddly baby merchandisingmascots and creepy prepubescent children with evil powers that has a thin story and uninteresting animation but my inner fiveyearold goes yay care bears every time i think about it so id only cautiously reluctantly recommend this movie for those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it like me or those lovably cynical genxyers who deliberately seek out the wonderfully badstrange a category in which this moviedefinitely belongs to those actually looking for a compelling movie or wholesome family entertainment you might want to keep looking,neutral
338,i really wanted to like this movie i absolutely love kenny hotz and spenny rice has a charming side to him not that i like spenny at all spenny ruins this movie he should of let kenny and his hot girlfriend pitch the movieanyways its pretty boring aside from a scene with roger ebert in it there really isnt too many celebrities in this movie and most dont seem to say more than one line overall this movie was disappointing i would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season dvd of kenny vs spenny it comes for free on the rd disc regardless of this production i am still very excited to check out the papel chase,positive

340,robert taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gunslinging buffalo hunter in this western it was one of the few times that taylor would play a heavy in a film nonetheless this picture was far from great as shortly after this taylor fled to television with the successful series the detectivesstuart granger hid his british accent and turned in a formidable performance as taylors partner taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the indians really showsanother very good performance here was by veteran actor lloyd nolan as an aged drinking oldtimer who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well in his early scenes nolan was really doing an excellent takeoff of walter huston in his oscarwinning role in the treasure of the sierre madre in note the appearance of russ tamblyn in the film the following year tamblyn and nolan would join in the phenomenal peyton placethe writing in the film is stiff at best by the films end its the elements of nature that did taylor in how about the elements of the writing here,positive

342,daraar got off to a pretty good start the first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next other than that the first half of the movie is a total bore all the first half of the movie is about is rishi kapoor falling head over heels in love with juhi chawla by the way dont you think hes a little old for herthings finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when juhi tells us about her previous husband and wow what a lunatic is he he was an overprotective neatfreak with a really hot temper he used to beat up poor juhi for no good reason one of the reasons i really dont like this movie is because i cant stand to see juhi my favorite actress get so abused this film in general has way too much abuse and bloodshed i find it so sickeninganyway all im trying to say is if youre thinking about renting daraar you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else,neutral
343,for the record this film is intriguing but its hardly original back in a movie starring talia shire called the landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger charactersthe story is amanda lear has had a bad life abusive father horny doctor mental homes etc shes finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctorwho she anally abuses and kills the poor guy now that was original the doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard after moving in she falls in love with a stud named richard who just happens to be married to a blues singer if youve seen the landlady you know the rest she kills or tries to kill anyone that gets in between her and richard including a roadiemuch of the ideas came from the previous movie same idiot sidekick that sticks his nose in same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn same flying a bodypress it did have some original material the beer bottle thing was brutal the highlight of the movie was amandas beautiful breasts in the hottop scene somewhat of a ripoff but not a total waste of time out of,neutral

346,shallow grave begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in psycho im leaning toward rip off after that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better almost to the point of being original bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story but the film already surpasses many in the yankee comes down south to get killed by a bunch of rednecks genre because it is actually shot in the southa group of college girls head to ft lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road note to yankees stay on the highway when you go to florida sue ellen lisa stahl has to pee so she heads into the woods when she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff tony march strangle his mistress merry rozelle to death note to yankees do not wander off into the woods when in the south not because you might witness a murder but you may run across a marijuana plantation this is the point where the story not the movie actually comes close to being goodwhile tony march will never have to practice his oscar speech his sheriff dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do tom law is likable as deputy scott and is as authentic a southern deputy as ive seen since walton goggins deputy steve naish in house of corpsesa few scenes in the movie are worth the mention the girls stop at a bbq in south carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out sue ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with herand in the strangest scene sheriff dean makes like hes about to rape patty carol cadby and tells her to take off her clothes dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what hes about to do the preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his bible his sermon is about how jezebel is saved by the blood of jesus christ i feel sorry for this preachers flock jezebel was in the old testament a few thousand years before christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in heaven,neutral

348,i saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as i thought sandra was quite funny from what i remembered the only facial movement i had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie i just suffered throughthe person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line just one scene that is even worth a chuckleshe is a much better singer than i remember her to be but i didnt want to watch a lounge acti think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and dont view it objectively,neutral

352,there was nothing of value in the original movie this one was even lamer the fact that i even found it to rent was absolutely amazing anyone connected to this film has to be high on something so what was the story line what was with the girl was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film sadly i tried several times to watch this i even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback kid said it was stupid and he was four years old i find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a b film that might be pushing it i did love the theme song good thing it was only a dollar it was worth it i suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be is pot legal in france,positive
353,as an altman fan id sought out this movie for years thinking that with such a great cast it would have to be at least marginally brilliantbig mistakethis is one of altmans bigcast mishmashes thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally or so it feels with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room it doesntas maltin points out this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of alfre woodard who outshines the vets all around her but other than that avoid at all costs which is pretty easy to do its never been released on video to my knowledge and its cable appearances have the frequency of halleys comet,positive
354,what an insult to olivia dabo who plays the films heroine robin to have keanu reeves appear so large on the box art of the film and at least on recent reissues to have only reeves appear on the box considering that she was the star i realize that it is his name that will ultimately sell this longforgotten after school special but at least give the woman some credit despite that this has to be one of the worst teen sportsthemed films that i have ever seen and it strives very hard to add not only every teen and sports movie clich from the class warfare between the feuding gymnasts to the teen romance and in striving to somehow deliver itself as an amateur alternative of flashdance with the music in one of the warehouse dance scenes is even quite close to michael sembellos notable maniac which was made famous by flashdance or was it the other way around it includes similar dance sequences and worse yet even the s dance and sports traditions of corny danceoffs between the heroine and her antagonists the one who doubts her successes and abilities on the team we saw this in trashin a vert ramp joust and rad bmx dancing at the prom although it wasnt much for competition but rather for fun for example in fact this movie is chock full of unrealistic corniness such as the somewhat homoerotic rolling in the clothes at the salvation army with robin and her friend from the teamnonetheless the film is about a young girl who comes from a rather poor background to top it off in a massive need to squeeze from audiences as much sympathy as possible she lives with her ailing mother her obnoxious sister and her careless and slightly abusive stepfather needless to say homelife is not so appealing add to the mix a talent for gymnastics but several obstacles to joining the team including the nuisance of her arrogant snobby teammates and a coach who also eventually doubts her abilities to compete well and of course we cant forget that shes got eyes for one of the pretty boy preppies who is dating one of the obnoxious teammates nor that she doesnt have a steady boyfriend although keanu as tommy later enters the picture could this kid be any more pathetic and it seems that one mess after another comes along to embarrass herself in her painfully long redundant and clichd quest to prove her worth to everyonebut even the major moments of cheesiness which comprise most of the film are hardly worth mentioning considering that the biggest distraction to this film is the horrible acting and dialog i like how the gym coach suddenly appears at the diner in the middle of the danceoff to scold the teammates it makes episodes of amazing stories look like shakespearei imagine anyone able to locate this film and watch it these days is probably drawn to it mostly because of the nostalgic factor for that you might be satisfied but it is also an incredibly forced drama so caveat emptour,neutral
355,its not really about gymnastics swap out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about archery or microbiology or a boogerflicking tournament instead like every other rockyflashdance derivative that flooded the s market its about conquering adversity with sticktoitiveness rendering all socialpersonal realities irrelevant by your lonesome with love interest standing by of course ronald reagan top to bottom in short so as a piece of cinema its down to the details some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up especially the love interest brought to you by none other than mr keanu reeves warming up for ted heroine olivia dabos hateful alkie dad and bighair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitchnemesesteammates one of whom appears to be made of porcelain its my instinct to be appalled by the comicrelief black guys but on the other hand at least theyre in the movie but dabo doesnt quite convince with her awkwardgirl shtick and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter its all just bodies hurtling around and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion its all performed by an obvious double,neutral
356,i only today picked this up at the cents only store today and i still think i got ripped off dream to believe is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and is just too freakin expensive for this this film is probably only notable for things it has a young keanu reeves and its directed by paul lynch the man who also did promo night now onto the movie its about a girl named robin played by olivia dabo who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her fathers life so the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named tommy played by keanu robin when not in training works parttime along with her mother and stepsister at a laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather eventually she is chosen to compete overall keanu alone and some catchy s tunes are what prevent me from giving this star and its also not one of the worst movies ever but still far from good the dvd itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old vhs and towards the end the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over it fades to black even though sound can still be heard so this can probably be passed as a bootleg the dvd artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of keanu and olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie as its also not in the movie itself so the covers obviously photoshopped in any case avoid at all costs unless youre a keanu fanatic i probably wont be hanging to it any longer im probably gonna give it to the cinema snob whos a great yt critic btw hey if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight feel free to donate to him to keep his show running,neutral

358,what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica albaunfortunately the powersthatbe over at fox decided that they needed to finetune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldnt sleepthe moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works dont screw with itazjazz,neutral

360,god i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot i had been expecting a lot from it as im a huge fan of james cameron and not just since titanic i might add and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality then again he also wrote the leaden strange days but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration in all that time it barely went beyond its two line synopsis and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere on top of that i dont think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular ateam episode as for alba yes she is gorgeous of course but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie pouty and surly makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude schtick pretty soon you can count me out of this one mr cameron,neutral

363,lillian hellmans play adapted by dashiell hammett with help from hellman becomes a curious project to come out of gritty warner bros paul lukas reprising his broadway role and winning the best actor oscar plays an antinazi german underground leader fighting the fascists dragging his american wife and three children all over europe before finding refuge in the states via the mexico border they settle in washington with the wifes wealthy mother and brother though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the german embassy playing poker it seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus and when we realize what the heart of the material is the wise honest direct refugees teaching the clueless headinthesand americans how the world has suddenly changed it seems a little patronizingthe viewer is quite literally put in the relatives place being lectured to lukas has several speeches in the thirdact which undoubtedly won him the academy award yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit enter and exit as his spouse bette davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage but the role doesnt allow her much color their children all with divergent accents are alternately humorous and annoying and geraldine fitzgerald has a nothing role as a putupon wife and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong the intent here was to tastefully tactfully show us just because a wwiiera man may be german that doesnt make him a nazi sympathizer we get that in the first few minutes the rest of this tasteful tactful movie is made up of exposition defensive confrontation and ultimately compassion it should be a heady mix but instead its rather dryeyed and inert from,neutral

365,it as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy it is not only oppressively preachy but absurd stagebound dramatically straightjacketed and painfully overwrought watching it one feels like an year old child being punished by having to write i will not become a fascist on the blackboard timesnow i understand that it was made during the height of ww and was intended to be a brave condemnation of hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about which anyone would wholeheartedly applaud and im sure it accurately captured the mood of the day but it is presented in such an immature overobvious sledgehammer way it fails abysmally as a work of artthe only good performances here are from paul lukas who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic antifascist and lucile watson as the amusingly illmannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships the children are ridiculously shown as robotically wellbehaved little snips they do not even remotely resemble real human beings and bette davis a great actress here is so one dimensionally noble i cringed every time she was on screen her every word her every gesture is meant to convey how supportive and understanding she is of the sacrifices her husband has to make and the great cause he is fighting for that she mustve been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayalso yes this is a very important film just not a very good one,neutral
366,there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the rhine is concerned one either likes it very much applauding its sincerity its liberal point of view and fine acting or else loathes its obvious propaganda mediocre dialogue cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness i fall very much in the latter category and found the film and playconcerning the activities of european refugees in washington during wartimea crushing bore worthwhile mostly for the acting and even then only intermittently that author lillian hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant her plays were written for people who shared her point of view and she seldom explored ideas that werent already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the other side is even when i find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to sayas in rhinei still cant stand the way she says it her characters are unreal and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality she really had nothing new to say i thoroughly agree with the late mary mccarthys long overdue dismantling of hellman reputation some years ago for those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days i urge a peek at watch on the rhine as bad in its way as angels in america which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago,neutral
367,the sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine this movie is no cabarnet and certainly no casablanca i agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sitcoms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy but lets look at the obsolete theme of the moviewith the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom since watch on the rhine author lillian hellman has been exposed as a bidenesque plagiarist with her so called reallife story julia from her book pentimento as one of the most odious of a plethora of westernbased ussr apologists it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir america to action to save the bloody soviet dictator stalin and international communism from the fascists who had just proved their military superiority in spainas one reviewer correctly noted this is not a proamerican play and movie as lillian went to her grave an americanloathing communist this film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the american left then just as now the full mooner left of the daily kos and michael moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy america,neutral
368,when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television weve all been guilty of it at some time or another but my excuse for watching things like buck rogers in the th century and silver spoons is this i was young and naive ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhilethankfully i now appreciate the good stuff stargate sg is not good the yearold me would love every hackneyed bit of it every line of stilted dialogue every bit of needless technobabble the writing is beyond insipid so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek voyager if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever youre in troublethe film stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure anchored by two solid performances by james spader and kurt russell full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture a wonderful musical score and cool scifi ideas with the exception of a little of the original music none of what made the film fun appears in this show even richard dean anderson who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting seems like hes half asleep most episodesthe budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebodys basement the cinematography isnt much better as vanilla and dull as the scripts it amazes me that shows with a lot more style like farscape and substance like the reimagined battlestar galactica have smaller less rabid fanbases than this pap it just doesnt deserve it,neutral
369,i cannot believe how popular this show is i consider myself an avid scifi fan i have read countless scifi novels and have enjoyed many scifi movies and tv shows i really wouldnt even consider this true scifi every episode i have sat through was like a lame watered down version of a star trek episode minus anything that might make it interesting or excitingits basically a bunch of people standing around in army fatigues talking about something boring who occasionally go through the stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like earth with people who look and sound just like humans it seemed extremely low budget the characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts and the many attempts at humor fall flat it reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it trying to be funny but he is not it is just sadthe movie was terrible as well there is so much you can do with a portal through space yet every place the army people go is boring this shows no imagination i actually thought the tv series alien nation from a few years back based on the movie alien nation was much better that show actually had good story lines and decent characters i wasnt crazy about alien nation but compared to this overrated crap it was greatalso unlike the great new battlestar galactica series stargate copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely they should have at least updated the cheesy toilet flushing special effect of whenever somebody goes through the stargate,neutral
370,im watching it now on pink serbia tv station and i must say this is a crap shallow no acting effects too sloppy i mean who made this seriesthis was a stupid attempt of the studios to make some more money on the success of the film ok the film was great in when it came out but the seriessome times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters i mean did they actually pay someone to write that was that someones relative at the studio this is no scifithe film was the bomb the series suck,negative
371,having seen the first ten episodes i must say this show sucks what bothers me the most is that the show was shot in canada i know its cheaper but they should have shot it in california so we could have had scenes in the desert that would have been more true to the movie the first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold that doesnt feel very egyptian what worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient egypt here it feels like theyre running around fighting aliens in a canadian forrest and its so lame that appaerantly on other planets the fall comes as well you can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside vancouver it just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb and then there is richard dean anderson he is no kurt russel sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy russels performance a little bit but he is just not as cool as russel and not nearly as good an actor as russel and russells way of playing o neill well he was much more cynical andersons o neil is way too soft i liked it that russels version just didnt give a s and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie michael shanks does a really good job as jackson though taking over from james spadertealc is a really annoying character he is jaffa not a jaffa just jaffa aaaarrgh a former bodyguard of a pathetic ra character seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far tealc speaks talks and acts like a robot ive seen better acting from jean claude van dammeand the fact that tealc and the ra character and the people they saved in the movie can speak english all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb what made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters as for the special effects they are really good in the pilot but the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap especially a planet they visit with crystals its so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background its an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds the xfiles had better effects when they aired their first episodes in that was years before sg started and they didnt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode that sg supposedly had they must have spend all the money on catering because i dont see it on the screen incredibly boring and pointless show that could have been great if they had shot the show in hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters,neutral
372,how is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth in different time frames attilla the hun wasnt a contemporary of preliterate hellenic cultures nor were the vikings contemporary to the pyramid builders speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day englishexcept for the inflections they do not use which has been influenced by latin ancient greek danish and french cultural differences cant be overcome so easily trust has to be won yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods the people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like historical background none visually it might vaguely remind you of greek or viking culture but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to look the part a smalltown theater group probably has better props boring another lame canuck production which inexplicably ran for ten long years as a kids show it could make the grade but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldnt bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season like i just did i very much wanted to believe i had found a decent scifi show otherwise i would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes,neutral

375,the plot of this terrible film is so convoluted ive put the spoiler warning up because im unsure if im giving anything away the audience first sees some man in jack the ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago then were up to modern day and a young australian couple is looking for a house were given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror some year old woman lived there there are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den an old fashioned straightrazor falls out when theyre renovating and the husband keeps it i guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams oh yeah the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money the husband murders the body guard a coworker and steals the money his wife is suddenly pregnant what the hell is going on who knows nothing is explained was the year old woman the child of the serial killer the baby sister why were iron panels put on the wall how would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar was he locked down there by his family starved to death or just concealed who is mr hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels hes never seen again why was the serial killer killing people we only see the one old man murdered was there a pattern or motive or something why does the wife suddenly become pregnant is it the demon spawn of the serial killer has he managed to infiltrate the husbands semen and why if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge burly security guard is he unable to overpower his wife and just how powerful is the voltage system in australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire and why does the wife stay in the house is she now possessed by the serial killer is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated this movie was such a frustrating experience i wanted to call my pbs station and ask for my money back the only enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time but even that couldnt redeem this muddled incoherent mess,neutral
376,that jamie foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful oscarwinning performance one of the reasons why i was so impressed with foxxs performance in ray was because from watching his hammy obnoxious acting in movies like bait and booty call i would never imagine he would ever hold the oscar if people told me five years ago that jamie foxx was one day going to win an oscar i would laugh right in their faces who knows maybe hes better off sticking to drama because if you watch bait its clearly evident that comedy is not his forte i swear jamie mugs so much in this movie that im surprised his face didnt fall off and why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets anyone familiar with comedians like bob newhart and steven wright knows that doing comedy doesnt require being loud and obnoxious if a joke is funny its funny if its not funny then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier the problem i have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character in real life normal people dont always have witty comebacks and quips like albert brooks said in an interview discussing his character in taxi driver its important to be funny as your character rather than be funny as a comedian a prime example of jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken and he starts posing for the photographs like a model if a regular person were being thrown in jail would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken and wouldnt the police try to scold him if he was there are many scenes like that throughout the film another awful sequence is one where jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain and he starts doing a phony caribbean accent not funny not to mention jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke giving a comedic performance requires patience whereas he goes straight to the punchline whether its the right time for it or not im not even a big mike epps fan but even his performance is good in comparison to jamies as a matter of fact this is the first time i felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy but at least he chooses a more lowkey approach one of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is david morse a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains he seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality however fellow green mile star doug hutchison is disgustingly overthetop as the villain a big surprise considering he gave a superb performance in the green mile also playing a heavy antoine fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like the replacement killers and training day even in bait he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence his only problem seemed to be in disciplining jamie foxx who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another unless youre a diehard fan of foxx please dont take the bait,positive
377,after a day at work i sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels the movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so i tuned in just before it started the first minutes were enough to make me interested but the lack of acting ability in jamie foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie if there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to david morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting all in all dont plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night,neutral

395,la sanguisuga conduce la danza or the bloodsucker leads the dance as i believe is its common english title is set on ireland in where the mysterious count richard marnack giacomo rossistuart invites soontobe out of work theatre actress evelyn patrizia webley as patrizia de rossi three more of her fellow soontobe out of work actress friends cora krista nell penny lidia olizzi rosalind marzia damon as caterina chiani to his castle situated on a small island just off the coast at first evelyn is reluctant but is persuaded when it is agreed stage hand samuel leo valeriano goes along as well once there count marnack tells his guests that his father grandfather both cut the heads off their cheating wives using a ceremonial knife theres a feeling of unease when it turns out that evelyn looks exactly the same as the current counts wife who ran away not too long ago along with having to worry about weirdo servants it turns out that someone wants to use the knife themselves to chop a few heads offthis italian production was written directed by alfredo rizzo is total complete utter crap from start to finish first things first lets start the criticism with the title the bloodsucker leads the dance lets examine that title because when i do i feel somewhat cheated that there arent any vampires or any form of bloodsucking whatsoever noone leads anything at anytime there most certainly isnt any dance or dancing so dont expect any of these things what you should expect though is a tedious dull boring pointless little giallo that takes over an hour before anyone is killed any sort of murder mystery starts to take shape the first hour of la sanguisuga conduce la danza is as plot less uninteresting as anything out there the best way to imagine it is to think of the most boring softcore porn film youve ever seen then cut most of the softcore porn out that just leaves bad actors bad dubbing bad dialogue a tiny bit of softcore sex lesbianism absolutely nothing else yep it really is that bad the mystery elements are crap people do illogical things for no apparent reason the overly complicated twist ending is as bad as the rest of it the sixth sense this aintdirector rozzi does an ok job la sanguisga conduce la danza actually has a nice look feel to it despite its obvious low budget i mean there are scenes where he shows a storm raging outside the castle however the stock footage used is in black white so the film jumps from bright colour to black white whenever it cuts to the storm back to colour again there is one absolutely hilarious scene where a maid her friend discuss her breasts she lets her friend feel them who is then full of compliments this scene is so funny just so unnatural that its priceless easily the films best moment even if a bad s porno would be embarrassed by the dialogue there is minimal nudity the sexlesbian scenes are very tame forget about any blood or gore as there isnt any apart from a decapitated headtechnically the films pretty good the period setting production design are actually quite impressive although its not massive in scope it does the job effectively enough the film has a nice sense of colour the cinematography is fine the film is dubbed so its hard to give an opinion on the original performances but the voice actors are terrible the dialogue is even worse than usualla sanguisuga conduce la danza is a terrible film it makes no sense it has virtually no story for over an hour it has possibly the most misleading title ever is really dull boring with a confused stupid twist ending as far as euro horror fans go there are plenty of much better films than this so please dont waste your time as for anyone else this is definitely one to avoid trivia note the notorious banned in the uk nazi exploitationhorror film horrifying experiments of the ss last days aka ss hell camp the beast in heat was directed by luigi batzella he has a fairly substantial role as a police detective in la sanguisuga conduce la danza,neutral
396,the bloodsucker leads the dance what a laughable title its so utterly misleading its not surprising that the filmmakers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible moviethe story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote islandvery little happens in this film and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voiceartists these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remediallevel morons it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal but the voiceartists cannot be blamed for the script its a travesty unintentionally funny at best pathetic at worst the story in general is to say the least uneven the women characters are particularly idiotic the men are either creepy or tediousthe whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience it doesnt remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders finally start happening they all occur off screen all we get is a few halfhearted severed head shotsa few people have said that this movie is a giallo i cannot agree less with this opinion anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it its basically a softcore porn film with a horror angle but its not very erotic eitheri cant recommend this to anyone,negative
397,the horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn gothic flicks each night from pm till about in the morning but their scare factor is very limited if one exists at all in fact i am sure i will find a multimillion pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offerthe bloodsucker leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel the undisputed low of a channel full of lows i cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is but for the purpose of completing the minimum lines demanded by this site i will at least give it a gofirstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen in fact the film might as well have been called toothbrush or wallpaper for all it has to do with the plot at least they used toothbrushesat least they had wallpaperthere are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances not one im sure they were making two different films by mistake herea more suitable title would have been horny italian count leads five people to a scary castle and bores us silly for ninety minutes yes that fits betterthe acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling and that guy who plays seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his characterabysmalthe only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off bonusotherwise steer a wide birth away from this one no vampires no dancing no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on gods earth i will ever ever ever watch this one againno word of a lie this film could put you off motion pictures for life,neutral
398,i saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny i saw it again last week and you can guess the result some funny parts in it very few and too long the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask meif you want a total bmovie this is a good pick but dont expect too much from aliens dwarf size,positive
399,this is a really dumb movie it could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting but it just isntsome aliens hear the broadcast of war of the worlds when a small country radio station plays it on halloween they come to earth to kill humans but instead of killing they make people their slaves and act goofy the front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in spacenot really what they do these arent party aliens they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices the alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the jack nicholson ripoff alien who always wears his sunglasses other than the aliens the acting is terrible the writing is obviously meant for children because every character is written like a kidthis is a dumb movie that only children will appreciate maybemy rating out of mins pg for mild language,negative
400,imagine youre a highschool boy in the back of a dark uncrowded theater with your girlfriend how bad would a movie have to be in order that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and head home before it ended this movie is that bad really movies often become so bad that theyre good this movie is beyond that stage of badness it is painfully bad horribly terribly crimeagainsthumanity bad,negative

402,sloppily directed witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the classic s alien invasion films but really is no better than them except of course in the purely technical department good makeup effects and any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail casino royale our man flint are worse than almost any james bond movie after two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens youll be begging for some peace and quiet,negative
403,dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result violent sexy milligan at his most home made little better than a home movie as much of milligans films are this is a trip into depravity s style notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome playing now more as quaintthough decidedly r rated the film suffers from its uneven cast and from the cheapness of the productionno one was ever sure where the money went on his movies since he was always broke its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a milligan completeist or because its got some good looking people fooling around,neutral
404,if youre after the real story of early baroque painter artemisia gentileschi youll be disappointed however if youre after a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme youve found youre moviethis film is such a foundationally inaccurate depiction of artemisia gentileschis life that it almost made me weep type in artemisia inaccuracies in google and check out some of the fact vs fiction articles from a purely technical point of view though the film was alright the sets costumes and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early th century experience although the above mentioned glaring factual inaccuracies let it down a biti wonder how the directorcowriter agns merlet defended her film at the time perhaps she refused to portray artemisia as a victim which wouldve been unfortunate because lets face it she was,neutral
405,as others have noted this movie is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the artists life and i for one was very annoyed and offended by its transformation of her rape into a tragic love affair by the implication that her rapist was responsible for awakening her talent by its complete disregard for her work by the way it turned her into a sex object on and on you get the idea also i find it disturbing that people who arent familiar with gentileschi will see this film and walk away with that kind of impression of her,neutral
406,artemesia takes the usual story about the art world eg you cant paint that but i want to and plasters it with sex and scandal to make the whole film well interesting but not remarkablethe story is about one of the first female painters around artemesia who course is fiercely independent but just cant stop thinking of men and their bodies for artistic purposes of course she soon gets private tutoring from one of a well known artist but soon tutoring becomes much more then art and soon after that scandal erupts funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a softporn fantasy i mean was artemesia that much of a manhungry person also its quite funny when shes insisting that she paints for herself yet falls for the first person she seesactually the story itself is quite fascinating and it ends with a trial which i always love but i wasnt too crazy about the male lead who played her teacher who looked rather like the person someone like that wouldnt fall for i woulda gone for the young fisherman p,positive
407,the acting is good the women are beautiful and the men are handsome so if youre looking for wellacted soft porn this movie is for you otherwise you are wasting your time the motivation of the main characters in particular the eponymous lead is often a mystery she could have just told the truth the truth as presented in the film not necessarily the historical truth and her lover would have been spared time in jail for a rape he did not commit was she protecting her father who went off halfcocked as it were when he impetuously instigated a malicious lawsuit was she protecting herself with her reputation suddenly of concern when heretofore only her art seemed to matter during the trial this strongwilled woman turns to mush before our eyes conversely her lover who starts off as a narcissistic jerk becomes a selfless hero during the trial at least his motivation is clearer he sacrifices himself for love naturally since no good deed must go unpunished we are told that she never sees him again,positive
408,an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe theyve taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that theyve taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but its simply bizarre by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script i suppose there werent enough naked people in the factual version its hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if theyd favored the rest of the film with same brevity,positive
409,what did the director think everybody who has read the biography of artemisia is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that tassi was guilty that fact shows the real independence and emancipation in her most terrible hour she stands her man why do movies depicting renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic are we afraid to see the gritty side of life or has the hollywood happyhappymood won while i would always defend a directors freedom to create his own reality in a movie i cannot make sense of turning artimisias life story on its head very disappointing choice by the makers of this film,neutral
410,this flick was a blow to me i guess little girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models home makers or mistresses since that seems to be all theyll ever be portrayed as anyway it is truly saddening to see an artists work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated inconcievably or perhaps it should have been expected artemisias entire character and all that she stands for had been reduced to a standard hollywood female character a pitiful physically flawless helpless little creature displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here sadder yet was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film and reality to portray the artist as someone in love with her reallife rapist someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture just plain pisses me off if the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person,positive
411,when i saw the preview i thought this is going to be a great movie and indeed it could have been the actress playing the main character was very credible and the beauty of the filming is undeniable however the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture the level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in and it took away most of the magic of the film however i must congratulate the translator because the english subtitles were more refined and appropriate that the original french cues and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd,positive
412,i was disgusted by this movie no it wasnt because of the graphic sex scenes it was because it ruined the image of artemisia gentileschi this movie does not hold much truth about her and her art it shows one piece of art work that she did judith beheading holofernese but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first judith for a year after the triali dont know if you understood this from the movie probably not tassi was not a noble character he raped artemisia it was not love it was rape he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia aka had sex with while she states over and over again its truei encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about dont base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie i encourage you to do some research artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art workdont see the movie but find out the true story of artemisia,neutral
413,i didnt think the french could make a bad movie but i was clearly very wrong as has been said before this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real artemisia gentileschi the script is awful pretentious stilted and vapid and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting rather than retelling history along with some fairly decent set design valentina cervis physical charms are the primary asset of this movie and its obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too they waste no time in contriving various erotic sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development unfortunately the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot and does not sustain this movie the acting is unremarkable and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two the cinematography is ok and there are some pretty colors but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distortedlens effects more appropriate for a s freakout movie than a costume drama in any event the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on artemisias body and all too seldom on her paintingsall told a nearcomplete failure its not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film and its too slow and pretentious to work as softcore pornography so the french can fail after all,neutral
414,it figures this is a french film lol with the emphasis on young girls with much older menwhy is it the french are so fixated on this kind of thing when the age difference is this great it really comes off as pervy valentina cervi is beautiful she bears a strong resemblance to olivia hussey of zeffirellis romeo and juliet set in a similar period but she looks about and the actor playing tassi her painting instructor lookswell is kindother posters have done the work of explaining the historical record unusually detailed in this case of the real artemisia a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period th century her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the ageold accusation that all great artists were men she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant not only was she clearly assaulted and forced into a degrading sexual relationship because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame but tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and childthe movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story very dramatic and not in need of any spicing up because in some weird frencified way its hotter to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather thats sexy the truth is boring and seems too feministpolitically correctit also disturbs me that this is only part of artemisia life considered interesting enough to film the fact that she painted for decades her famous painting of judith beheading holfernes was painted after not before the rape that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious florentine academy that she went on to have childrenoh thats boring stuff after all thats about a middle aged woman and they arent hot like teenagersi understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film or a book about a real historical character you need to create dialog have subplots create dramatic structure certainly some details can be sacrificed its no big deal if the dates are moved a few years or if artemisia is played by a blonde actress when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunetteand a big boned one not a skinny minny or something like that but to turn her story around on her and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing its even worse because the director is female she should be horribly ashamed of herselfif you like this and i know some people could care less about the real woman artist and just like period costumes and hot sex you will probably like dangerous beauty with rufus sewell and catherine mccormack similarly based on heavily rewritten history with lots of heaving bosoms and jewel encrusted goblets bon appetit,neutral
415,any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesnt bother with an actual story its annoying those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first and the story simply tacked on for this reason we often talk of the story jumping through hoops as it twists about trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashionthe story in comet over broadway doesnt just jump through hoops its a three ring circus its so ludicrous so illconceived so disingenuous that if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen you will be carrying on quite a rant before its throughthe central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession since its all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion so in the end theres no point to the story the theme becomes irrelevant and as is often the case with poor screenplays the acting doesnt save a thing,negative
416,stars for kay francis shes wonderful and she didnt deserve this horrible tripe that warner bros threw her way the twopronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme kay is a smalltown wife and mother who yearns for something bigger she wants to be an actress when a bigshot actor comes to town and invites kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities kay tells her husband shes going to the movies the hubbys biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubbys ear that kays not being truthful and he sets out looking for her he finds her w the actor in the hotel they are only talking and he slugs the guy who falls over a railing lands facefirst in a pond lake and dies now heres the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based the judge tells the jury that if its determined that the man died before his head went into the water that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder whaaaaa i think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder at the most not first degree murder give me a break but the plot required him being found guilty of murder so that he could be sent to prison for life whatever the hubbys lawyer after the conviction and sentencing tells kay that its all her fault his reasoning is that if she hadnt gone over to the actors room then her husband wouldnt have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him he tells her that shes the guilty one not her husband and she nods and agrees what the hell the rest of the movie is all about kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first placei cant even go on with this review the movie was just all too painful four years earlier in the precode days youd never have caught kay playing such a wimp in true kay francis fashion though she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character i give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role this character was a far cry from precode kay roles and reallife spitfire kay francissteer way clear of this one there are much better kay francis vehicles out there from personal experience i can highly recommend mary stevens md and jewel robbery also good are dr monica and one way passage im sure theres other great kay flicks as well but im only mentioning the ones ive seen and can recommend,neutral
417,wow the plot for this film is all over the place there is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin and as a result none of it seemed particularly believablethe movie starts with kay francis as a housewife living in a small town shes had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to broadway when a bigtime actor arrives in town she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost but her husband is worried about shenanigansas this actor is a cad so the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actorand the actor dies as a result hes convicted of first degree murder not manslaughter but murder now pregnant and in need of funds kay goes to new york but broadway jobs arent to be found so shes forced to take any jobeven burlesque unable to adequately care for her young daughter she gives it to another woman to raise however eventually she does find a job in a real broadway play and everything looks rosy but the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play despondent she makes her way to england and becomes a real star years later she returns to new york to get her kidbut the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother at the same time her husbands lawyer now thinks that if he gets he can get the man out of prison as another reviewer wrote is this to bribe people how can get him out otherwisemaybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up wowthis is enough for or films and all this occurs by the minute mark believe it or not theres quite a bit more to it if you really care see it yourself to find out how it all unfoldsthis is sort of like kitchen sink writingthrowing in practically everything and hoping somehow it will all work unfortunately the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite ms francis best efforts its the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a ndrate plot its almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie overall unless you are a diehard kay francis fan or love anything hollywood made in the s this one is one you can easily skip not terrible but certainly not goodby the way the child who plays francis daughter upon her return to new york sybil jason really was terrible i think she was supposed to bei think,neutral
418,the competition for the worst warner bros kay francis movie is stiff ive only seen perhaps eight of them but comet over broadway is the worst so far the very best thing about it is that its short oh and the orrykelly gowns of course are fine james wong howes cinematography is not kay francis throughout looks fatfaced and far less attractive than she normally does minna gombell whom i dont know otherwise is good as a semitough burlesque dancer it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque the closing shot kay francis and her child when did the child learn that kay francis was her mother did i doze off walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous the whole film is so cheap so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it warner bros tossing garbage to dolts who dont know in warner bros cynical estimation of them that what theyre getting is garbage,neutral
419,i read somewhere that when kay francis refused to take a cut in pay warner bros retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contractshe decided to take the money but her career suffered accordinglythat might explain what she was doing in comet over broadway though it doesnt explain why donald crisp and ian hunter are in it too ludicrous is the word that others have used for the plot of this film and thats right on target the murder trial her seedy vaudeville career her success in london her final scene with her daughter no part logically leads to the next partalso the sets and costumes looked like bmovie stuff and her hair turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month watch any other one and youll be doing yourself a favor,positive
420,when converting a book to film it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the authors intended tone or conveyed concepts rather than ignoring the author altogether while it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of elinore stewarts children it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good enriching strengthening experiences of homesteading her land the book details her life on her and her husbands adjoining homesteads in the vast wyoming frontier she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances though they lived dozens of miles apart the film however takes a standard stance for the time it was made portraying this womans experience as harsh unforgiving and nearly pointless perhaps the director was bringing some of his vietnam war experiences with him to this movie as some film aficionados have said but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak odious landscape devoid of friends or hope dont waste your time with this movie read the book instead,neutral
421,one of the most disgusting films i have ever seen i wanted to vomit after watching it i saw this movie in my american history class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the west during the late s what we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered human birth branding oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasnt too bad but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom the story itself was ok the premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy they live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the west during the late s but if you have a choice do not see this movie,neutral
422,i realize that living in the western plains of wyoming during the s was brutal in fact it probably is still brutal today but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly madefortv movie also womens rights were still budding in this nation during this time so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory and still show the realism of the era would it make for good viewing honestly i dont know i have thought about this film for the past two days and i still cant seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film yet i can truthfully tell you that it wasnt the greatest i have ever seen from several hodgepodge styles of acting to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character to some of the most gruesome pg rated scenes to ever come out of late s cinema it is hard to fully get a good grasp on heartland was it good was it bad that may be up for you to view and decide yourself but until then here are moments i enjoyed and desperately hated this film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes scenes where i wasnt sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole i thought the story as a whole was a very interesting historical tale i do not know much about living in wyoming especially during the early s so this film captured that image in my mind the thought of very cold winters no neighbors for miles upon miles and this polaroidesquire view untouched by corporate america it was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience though the television there were scenes that really stood out in my mind like the cattlebranding scene the pig slaughtering scene and the saddening homesteader that didnt survive their journey that just brought a true sense of realism to this story director richard pearce did a great job of bringing the view of wyoming to the viewers but i am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the viewwhile i will constantly compliment the scenery of this film i had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side rip torn seemed out of place in his role as clyde stewart a loner that somehow finds a connection with conchata ferrells elinore randall the two as actors have no chemistry at all their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion the pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two veteran actors portrayed it the brave elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her while clyde gives an approving nod when she is done this is love was it supposed to be love i dont know i think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond but with torn and ferrell it felt like two actors just playing their parts other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse knocks on the door for food or shelter the constantly fading and growing compassion that clyde had for elinores daughter i just didnt believe it the lack of true winter struggle and the entire land scene the land scene especially because i needed more explanation on what elinore was doing why she was doing it and why clyde would build her a house if they were married it was these simple events that if taken the time to explore would have made for a stronger filmoverall i will go middle of the road with this feature there were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of elinore but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation these panoramic scenes which in the span of years have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers while there were some brilliant scenes of realism starring cattle and pigs i just felt as if we needed more depth was a key element lacking in this film which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world but instead left open loopholes and clichd western characters ferrell carried her own but torn was completely miscast decent for a viewing but will not be picked up again by megrade out of,positive
423,thats what my friend brian said about this movie after about an hour of it he wasnt able to keep from dozing off i had been ranting about how execrable it was and finally i relented and played it having run out of adjectives for boring imagine if you will the pinnacle of hackwork something so uninspired so impossibly dreadful that all you want to do after viewing it is sit alone in the dark and not speak to anybody some people labor under the illusion that this movie is watchable it is not not under any form of narcotic or brain damage i would only recommend this to someone in order to help them understand how truly unbearable it is dont believe me gather round granted as a nation we in america dont always portray middle eastern peoples in a tasteful manner but how about a kid in a sheik outfit bowing in salaamfashion to a stack of castrol motor oil bottles youll find that here get it the arab worships oil i couldnt believe what i was seeing having the kid fly planes into a skyscraper wouldve been more appropriate who in their right mind would think that was a funny joke its not even close to cleverly offensive it just sucks and makes you want to punch whomever got paid to write that bit in the face in the middle of the film a fiveman singing group called the landmines takes the stage at an officers ball okay are you ready the joke is they sing terribly and offkey why did i write that in caps also because the joke is pound pound pounded into your head with a marathon of horrendous sight gags they start off mediocre enough glasses cracking punch tumblers shattering then there is i am serious a twoframe stopmotion sequence of a womans shoes coming off you read that correctly the music was so bad in one frame the womans feet have shoes on in the very next the shoes are off get it because the music was so bad her shoes came off what the f then there is an endless montage of stock footage to drive home the point that the singing is bad if any human being actually suffered through this scene in the theater without running like hell i would be astonished this movie is honestly like a practical joke to see how fast people would bolt out the doors robert downey sr directs comedy the way his son commands respect by staying drugfree badly other things to watch out for the popular music shoehorned in wherever possible every time liceman appears a really inappropriate iggy pop song plays plus all the actors do their best to act like it got really chilly for some reason barbara bachs criminally awful accent she sounds like shes trying to talk like a baby while rolling a marble around on her tongue there is no nudity and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and writhe from a glimpse of her cleavage like theyre in a community school acting class and theyve been directed to act like aroused retarded people liceman feeds his revolting dog a condom remember when this movie came out throwing in abortion and condom was seen as edgy tom poston plays a mincing boyhungry pedophile back when hollywood thought pedophile and homosexual were one in the same flatout embarrassing watch the ending nothing is wrong with your vcr that is actually the ending tell me that doesnt make you want to explode everyone whos ever made any movie ever watch this at your own risk up the academy has been known to actually make other movies like the jerk or blazing saddles less funny simply by placing the videotape near them,neutral
424,the only thing i remember about this movie are two things first as a twelve year old even i thought it stunk second it was so bad that when mad magazine did a parody of it they quit after the first page and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed itif you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period try animal house its so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art another good selection would be caddyshack the classic with the late rodney dangerfield and bill murray before he became annoyingly charming with great lines like greens keeper carl spacklers correct me if im wrong sandy but if i kill all the golfers theyll lock me up and throw away the key,neutral
425,a stale misfitsinthearmy saga which halfheartedly attempts to be both surreal the foreign subtitles and vulgar the flatulence gags but just ends up being a mix of many different kinds of humor none of them followed very successfully barbara bach the bond girl from the spy who loved me has only two or three brief scenes what a waste,neutral
426,i used to love this movie as a kid but seeing it again years later it actually sucks up the academy might have been ahead of its time back in but it has almost nothing to offer today movies like caddyshack and stripes holdup much better today than this steaming dogpile no ta no great jokes except for the oneliners weve all heard a million times by nowi recently bought the dvd in hopes that it would be the gem i remembered it being well i was way off the soundtrack had only widelyrecognizable hits not the smash compilation others had mentioned and the frequent voiceovers were terrible the only thing that was interesting to me was predicting what the characters lines were before they said them yep i watched this movie that much back then the only reason i am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten sorry to say,neutral
427,mad magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for itbut obviously someone there had some common sense when the powersthatbe disowned this waste of celluloidthe editing is el crapo the plot is incredibly thin and stupidand the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that stacy nelkin takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice chest shoti never thought i would feel sorry for ralph macchio making the decision to be in this thing but i doand i really feel bad for ron leibman and tom poston gifted actors who never should have shown up in this piece offilmat least mr leibman had the cajones to refuse to have his name put anywhere on the movieand he comes out aheadthere are actually copies of this thing with mads beginning sequence still on itif you can locate one grab it cuz it is probably worth somethingits the only thing about this movie thats worth anythingand a note to the folks at imdbcomthere is no way to spoil this movie for anyonethe makers spoiled it by themselves,neutral
428,before i comment on this movie i just watched on youtube i have to admit that the reason i checked this out was to rewatch something i first saw on the tv ads in barbara bachs cleavage and since the movie received an r rating i expected to see her nude alas no dice for her or of the other gorgeous actress that appeared here stacey nelkin whos supposed to be a teen but was actually when she made this seeing her in a bra and panty and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as arousing as ms bach they provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides in fact i dont blame ron leibman for having his name removed from the credits since his role as the tightfisted liceman is pretty embarrassing though i did like the seduction scene he did with ms nelkin this also happens to be the debut of ralph macchio whos the loner among the misfits sent to an academy school the others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and ms bach an arab who worships motor oil and a politicians son who loves his girlfriend candy nelkins character so much he risks sneaking in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy among the supporting cast tom poston plays a swishy character named sisson who i found partly amusing with a screenplay by tom patchett and jay tarses and direction by robert downey sr whose son robert downey jr has a cameo early on in a soccer scene up the academy is uneven with the politically incorrect humor but unless youre really offended at the scatological and sexual content this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that mad magazine and its trademark cover boyalfred e newmanshouldnt be ashamed of even though they once had their name and character taken off the pictureps another one of the misfits was harry teinowitz who was born in my birth town of chicago ill he played rodney ververgaert he also says one of my favorite lines im trying to come,neutral
429,there are bad movies terrible movies even boring moviesi can watch most and put up until the end not this time avoid this like the plague annoying music throughout terrible editing no comedy its tackier than a novelty mugmy missus wanted to watch this thinking it would be legally blonde material or something kind of watchable but never better than average chick flick its the first time she was begging me to push the stop buttonthe girls well they were not great to start with denise done ok in starship troopers and wild things but you have sank to the gravel i feel like a mug having spent minutes on thispamela anderson is almost unrecognisable after much construction work to her faceplease take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells ranting at the utter mince that is on your screen,negative
430,how could i best express my feelings about this movie hideous a headache lack of coherent writing plain stupidity try all of the above for this travesty and that just for the directionstory well i guess there is a story two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course they are mistaken for a world renounced assassin sarcasm and are hired by two mobsters one thinks taking him out means a date and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of and of course the turtle reserve for the farting turtle that they build with the casino winningssounds likes all this could be funny guess again they try to make it funny but its not filming sequences arent well done ive seen better filming in hong kong movies visuals are average for a late s film but the problem is that its a movienot worth my time to ever watch this again it still doesnt beat danny glovers out movie from the early s as the worst movie of all time but then again that film is in a class of its own f,neutral
431,when i was at the movie store the other day i passed up blonde and blonder but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie who knows i mean im sure most people bashed romy and michelle before they saw it blonde and blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up but when i started watching it executive producer pamela anderson wow i knew i was in for something scary not only that but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness pam anderson and denise richards not to offend them but they were not aging well at all and theyre playing roles that i think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their s not their s the story was just plain bad and obnoxiousdee and dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blondes they really dont have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world its just really sad but when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ignorance is bliss attitudes they are set up to make a hit on a guy and they think theyre just going to show him a good time but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girlsdenise and pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before i know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy but it was more than stupid it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary would i ever recommend this not in a million years the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as sex kittens its more a sign of desperation and blonde and blonder is a huge blonde bombshell,neutral
432,this movie is not in anyway funny it tries to be funny with its lame humor which is so dry and boring that the movie is just hours of torture throughout the whole movie i was thinking one thing when is this gonna end one thing you have to hand to them is that they do have a very few mildly funny moments which is also why i gave it a whole stars it is unoriginal and uses up almost every old blonde joke in the book even the ones that wasnt funny the first time it basically is a movie to belittle blondes and to record the whole repetoir of blonde jokesto sum it all up this movie is blonde humor gone bad it is not worth paying any amount of money to watch it is just that bad,neutral
433,blonde and blonder was unfunnybasically it was a ripoff girl version of dumb and dumber but less funny and they used too much background noises and musicway too much background noises and music if you ask meit starts out immensely boring and totally inaneit doesnt pick up pace anywhere soon and i was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried onmaybe the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a was the last minutesi found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it neared the end but that was the only partalso i couldnt help but like pamela anderson and denise richards characters a littleeven though this movie didnt get any laughs from me it kept my attentioni wouldnt say to completely avoid this movie but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than blonde and blonder,neutral
434,this has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time awful acting awful script and they were the good points one to definitely miss the jokes if you could call them that were so predictable as to be pathetic pamela anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic i sat willing to give it a chance hoping that it was going to improve which alas it didnt if it was a choice between this and a book i suggest you settle down for a good read i like denise richards which is why i gave this movie a go but why she has let her self be cast in this movie is beyond me,negative
435,warning avoid this super duper awful movieif you watched it you will be sooooooooo disappointedpam and denise are grandma age now what are they doing trying so hard to be young innocent and sexy just not working at all pam and denise act so horribly in this movieplus the script is absolutely atrocious i cant believe someone can came out with such crappy ideas with the development of movie industry movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century i bet the movie goers from last century will hate this toostay away from it i think watch white chicks from its so much better that thismake no mistake at that time i thought thats the worst movie i have ever seen,negative
436,i was required to watch the movie for my work so i didnt pay for it on the contrary i got paid but i still found the movie to suck far more than average the jokes were lame the two lead actresses well to use the first wives club division of womens ages in hollywood they are no longer in their hot chick age but more in their district attorney age what angered me most about the movie was the main plot line which pretty much completely plagiarized beavis butthead do america in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to do his wife not realizing theyre expected to assassinate her all in all a bland piece of crap,neutral
437,i was looking for a cute simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistakei cant write a single good thing about it first the script is stupid and not funny at all relying on tired recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs in my book thats not funny thats patheticlow budget effects if i can even call them effects with horrible cinematography in many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no moneyacting i feel sorry for the actors are pamela anderson and denise richards that desperate for some money that theyve agreed to take part in this looking at their recent filmography it would appear so despite the outfits pamela is showing her age and as a whole they dont even come across as sexy let alone funnythis movie is not even in the sobaditisfunny category its just bad as if everybody involved was sick of itavoid,negative
438,what is this crap my little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly girlie dvd art and title i decided to watch it with her so she didnt get bored and i sure was appalled at the horrible qualityfirst the acting was terrible they seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards the delivery is subpar and very formulaic scene cuts were terrible it looks like they took it straight from the story board if there was onesecondly the jokes and stereotypes werent original or well played at all again very formulaic i cant count the times i was able to predict the next joke i got a few chuckles out of the blatantly subtle sexual innuendos the cat the beaver patch hung wong cmon just stay away from this movie its not cute its not funny its not even stupidfunny its just stupidstupid its like a pg kids movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo vulgarity and violence to bump the mpaa rating stay awaywould you like to ride my yachtis that what theyre calling it nowyou could ride my dingoh i think i got blood on my stoolbadly played sir,negative
439,sure i like short cartoons but i didnt like this one naturally kids would love it but then again im not a kid anymore although i still consider myself youngi will not tell you anything about the story for the simple reason there is no story how is it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an oscar well i guess its because people in the s were more happy with not much than now in the present where we live everything must happen fast look at the movies nowadays and you will come to the same conclusion we live in a society that doesnt allow men to be slow thats really a shame i wish i lived in the s because it seems so peaceful but every time has got its ups and downs i guessto conclude if you like music and frogs youll have to see this cartoon otherwise dont spill your time on it,positive
440,add to the list of caricatures a southern preacher and congregation a torch singer sophie tucker a dancing chorus and the mills brothers it only makes it worsecontemptible burlesques of negro performers who themselves often appear in films to be parodying themselves and their race though the negro comedy may have been accepted in its day its extremely offensive today and i doubt that it was ever funny though i wouldnt have been offended i dont think that id have laughed at the feeble attempts at humor as an yearold white boy however i might not have understood some of it,neutral
441,even thought im not the biggest of cher fans this movie was her crowning achievement granted there were long term sideeffects and risks of brain damage memory loss and intellectual impairment upon the screening such a film a survey of moonstruck fans by the uk advocacy network revealed that onethird of moonstruck fans surveyed believed moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding claimed it had irreparably destroyed their mindscher plays someone very uncher in this movie a dowdy young widow named loretta living in new york with her extended family theyre antiamerican proitalian and always at each other in someway she has been going out with johnny camarary for a while a nice mammas boy man and he asks her to marry him she says yes i loved her moms questions do you love him loretta no good if you love him hell drive you crazy because they know they can but you like him then oh yeah hes a sweet man ma when johnny goes off to sicily to care for his dying mother he asks that loretta make contact with his brother who hes been estranged from for yearsthis victory for human rights carries even greater significance as sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment in italian psychiatrist ugo cerletti saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs easing the job of slitting their throats cerletti was inspired and began experimenting with electroshock on humans developing the first electroshock machine broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concernthis wasin so many ways an antiamerican movie its about love to be sure but its also about infidelity secrets lonely people and strange behavior brought on by american policies the characters from the frumpy bobo at the favorite restaurant the aunt and uncle her parents and their problems the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters its somewhat of a chick flick as its how loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp its a cinderella story in many ways and that is every little girls dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swanassuming free and fully informed consent it is well to reaffirm the individuals right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses but we might ask ourselves whether we as fans of cinema though in no way sworn to any hippocratic oath should be offering it,positive
442,generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course dean martin songs problem is nicholas cage there is no chemistry between he and cher and they are the central love story cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to cages shifting accent and out of control body language cage simply never settles into his role he tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and thats whats needed in a love story cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a jimmy stewart type character cage keeps taking these roles perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesnt lend itself to them though hes gotten better at it with repeated attempts he should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self,positive
443,ok first the good chers performance and the cinematography although im no cher fan she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written the cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romancethe rest a thin plotline nicholas cages performance and a totally unhumorous and weak attempt to portray an italianamerican family from new york firstly everytime time cage opened his mouth i cringed i dont know what kind of accent he was trying use i honestly dont it sure wasnt any new york or italian accent ive ever heard it was quite surreal and it wasnt because im some stickler for accuracy his voice just cloyed in my ears and i like nicholas cage in other performances secondly and this is purely anecdotal but i have many italian relations friends and acquaintances in new york city and frankly ive gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided and that would be on a boring night at the house what a let down,positive
444,i watched this movie for a project on love please tell nicolas cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character and then reread the lines hes saying my life cannot go on i accidentally cut off my own handmy brother was close by obviously his fault and since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of mom sad and alone no closure bad script and doesnt have enough extension of minor characters save yourself unless your up for a good laugh costumes were done appropriately and extras did a fabulous job im sure it would have been a fun movie to make but keep it more genre specific i cant recommend this movie to anyone i know because it is not an intellectual movie it is not a chick flick it is not a strict romantic and i cant show kids because of the sex and questions to follow all in all just not a good flick,positive
445,i dont care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that this movie stunk i didnt know whether to turn off the set or file a lawsuit with ojs attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health i have seldom been this bored to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every moviegoer across the planet the whole story was stupid the acting was uninspired the drama was emotionless i am thankful i didnt have to pay for this unfulfilling experience,neutral
446,this show is painful to watch it is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show from the ever changing jobs boyfriends and cast it appears that they wanted to cast amanda bynes in something but had no idea what and came up with this crappy show they cast her as a teen surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy soon they realize that she needs a clique and cast people in their late s to try to pass as teenagershow this show survived seasons is beyond me somehow abc has now decided that it is a family show and thrown it into its afternoon lineup on abc family,negative
447,ill admit ive only watched a handful of episodes but each one seemed completely different from the next it seems after the first season the producers decided to completely retool the show drop characters introduce new ones and rewrite the entire show dynamicas you have probably surmised already the show is about quirky unpredictable teenager holly amanda bynes who moves in with her high strung sister valerie jennie garth in new york city decent enough premise odd couple fish out of water high jinxwhile i miss the sitcoms of yore this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly and its sad because they have some decent talenton top of everything they insisted on changing the show val was living with a cast regular bf one season then he was suddenly gone so she opens a bakery what when things change that drastically you get the feeling that even the show knows its bad i mean completely new sets characters written off and new show regularson a side note this is just nitpicking i know this is a television show and not real at all but val and holly end up living in a huge loft duplex there are stairs with a terrace in manhattan are you serious,neutral
448,what i hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written these women have no selfrespect or dignity the entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys amanda bynes talent is completely wasted she was brilliant on all that and her own show why they would write her and jenny garth as vapid airhead desperate men chasing oldmaid wannabes is beyond metheir plots and dialog remind me of the simpons homer says whenever his cartoon character poochie is not on screen everyone should ask wheres poochie all the talk centers on whining about some guy and then whining to some guy sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead then they get back together or break up at the end the women are either shallow stupid or sex addicts the only word i can think of is sucks,negative
449,well what can you say about sitcoms there often quite lame morale dedicative and just plain so is this show it got a boring cast although abynes is okej in her perky way the rest is just stereotypical crapas always we have all seen it before and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled cause lets face it its a mediocre and self righteous show as the most sitcoms arewell in short if you wanna see some good entertainment you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror do some faces and move on its more entertaining than this show,neutral
450,this was disappointing it started well enough but as it went on and lost every opportunity to soar it fell flat maria schraders acting is dreadful never seeming to mean what she says or even knowing what she says until she says it she showed no genuine emotion at all not for her beloved goy or her mothers story when with lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in lenas story there never seemed to be a real relationship between lena and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding which isnt much the supposed parallel between hannahs mixed romance and her mothers relationship with her father was as clich as they come and failed miserably anyway the wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish the climax of the protest was uninspiring and no matter what lena had or had not done to influence the outcome she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time a haunted look an inexplicable ambivalence in fact none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark it was very hard to care about any of them even little ruth everything with luis was a distraction why did she dis him so when on the phone from the hotel there was no context or explanation whatever for that if every reference to him was removed it wouldnt be noticed a simple story made confusing by poor character development who was whose mother again weak acting and directing that made everyone look like they were acting you could almost hear quiet on the set i started thinking this was worthy of a but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a then earning a after the silliness of the wedding scene this was about as cold and sterile a movie as i have seen a terrible waste of a good story,negative
451,one thing that astonished me about this film and not in a good way was that nathan stoltzfus who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the rosenstrasse was one of the historians working on this film considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded another reviewer said that von trotta said she never meant for lena to bed goebbels but in that case why did she give every impression that that was what had happened why not show other possible reasons for the mens release such as the disaster that was stalingrad or the nazis fear that the international press based in berlin would find out about the protestalso why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history in places it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in commonoverall this film failed in its aim which was to draw attention to a littleknown act of resistance which is a shame because done better it could have had a major impact,positive
452,spoilers in thisrosenstrae is a movie about heroic women in german nazi time but it is way too long it is not touching and sometimes even boring there are too many clichs and not enough good actingthe storytelling storyline is bad like in james camerons titanic an old woman remembers events of her live good now weve got a point of view than there is another woman introduced who does the same confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people come on this is a lack of knowledge of basic story tellinghow can riemann know about the fate of the little girls mother and her interrogation for examplethe scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place for example the scene when riemann is proposing to fabian when did that happen the scene looks like it is set in the twentiesriemanns character is of course a talented pianist well she is even a baroness wow her brother comes back from the eastern front he has received a ritterkreuz which he is showing in some scenes so he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience and he gained knowledge of massacres committed by germans he even made some photographs and so it goes clich after clich is piling up and this is why the movie does not workbasically von trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie and in the end its all very simple riemann finds a way to get goebbels into bed and ta da everyone is free which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the true story claim at the beginning like sass it is vaguely based on a true eventit is sad but true this is the typical german movie these days it is bad macaulay j connor,neutral
453,overall an extremely disappointing picture very very slow build up to the basic storyline the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past every take seems to last forever there is really no rhythm in the film spoilers her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis by a german woman played by katja riemann the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film cuts back and forth between present day new york and berlin and berlin s something please when you do that give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place there is never a clear indication of time very annoying worst part is the end spoilers the entire show and jabber about the jews being so terribly tormented simply by a bureaucratic accident give me a break thats how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse the question of who freed the jews is never answered was is goebels who freed them did lean fischer sleep with goebels in venice the film won an acting award for k riemann why i have no idea must be the jewish theme,negative
454,this game was made by sega being made by sega i didnt expect much but i also didnt expect this junk either for starters the camera angles work against you in this game the motorcycle is your means of getting around the motorcycle is the worst part in the game whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you dont move you never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter the main character hardly talks even though hes got a voice that suits him the graphics are horrible you ride through trees on your bike the camera makes fighting the enemy impossible this game wouldnt even be worth renting,negative
455,we dont have this on television in england but i walked it over the internet on youtube its dumb immature and boring this is from the creator of earthworm jim douglas tennapel i never got into that cartoon but i must admit it better than this the cartoonist hasnt done anything for years since now for doug tennapel this is a comeback travesty and an all time low the story is about three cats who inherit a house and lots of money off their dead old lady master they are argumentative and keep on disagreeing on what their want to spend their money on boring the animation is dreadful the main characters are meant to be cats right but they dont look nothing like cats just weird animal monsterlooking creatures with big mouths pointed teeth and bulgy eyes the human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly the theme song is terrible and irritating also the stories are lame and are most probably copied from older shows it surprised me how this show got votes of other imdb viewers television really isnt what is used to be but now most of them is dumb cheaply made and boring some of you on the website might not agree with me well im sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and feel glad that britain dont have too tolerate this crap oh yeah if you have digital you have to but i dont so it not my problem loser and its very lucky to get that because ive given other shows worst,negative
456,here be spoilers recap mia helin is returning home from capital stockholm to rural rttvik to celebrate her fathers th birthday she is by far the youngest child and has two sisters eivor ernst and gunilla petrn eivor has a family and still lives in rttvik and gunilla has divorced and moved a town away mia is still single and is focused on her career there are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle as the party goes on and alcohol consumed more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arisecomments to be the work of a new writerdirector it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older swedish comedydramas has been following for years there are really no new elements or ideas this movie draws upon three basic areas embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves sorrow and anxiety this move has the focus on the last one almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along no loss though since the humor that is there is not funny the performances from the cast are good i guess though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten i had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences but there were none to conclude there are better ways to spend ones time than watching this,neutral
457,just a stilted ripoff of the infinitely better murder she wrote it is absolutely amazing that this poorlywritten garbage lasted for a full eight years im sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do or simply remembered its star from the old dick van dyke show van dyke who only had a decent career in the s never was much of an actor at all by his own admission and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in he looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking his talentless real life son barry a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didnt involve his father plays his son in the series,positive
458,this is an anthology horror film its made up of short stories taken from the fiction of robert bloch who wrote for weird tales and was personal friends with hp lovecraft but is most famous for the original story psycho the quality of the stories is very uneven and i didnt think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all it would have been better to do it as a comedy like comedy of terrors only the last of the stories was really done in a humorous way and its probably the best of them the one with ingrid pitt ive seen a few of these amicus anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was freddie francis tales from the crypt the anthology style works well for the producers because it means that they can hire a bunch of big name actors employ them for only one week of shooting or so and then bring in the next big name so you essentially pay for weeks of movie star salary but get or different names on the marquee but thats very unfortunate for the audience because the audience would like to see some scenes with peter cushing christopher lee and ingrid pitt actually acting together instead theyre stuck in these vignettes by themselves so lets take them one at a time brieflythe first story has denholm elliot who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character unfortunately the actor who plays dominic the source of the horror tom adams just looks silly which ruins any possible horror theres some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though like the scene where dominic kills elliots psychiatrist its the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching so the whole audience is supposed to shout out look out behind you the second story is the one with peter cushing god i love that man so much too bad so many of his films like this one pretty much stink in the story hes supposed to be pining away for a longlost love and he sees her likeness in a wax museum its a completely predictable story that goes nowherethen you have the bit with christopher lee where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs but instead were supposed to be horrified when lee slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil the actress chloe franks was pretty good in that type of bad seed role thoughthe last story is kind of amusing ingrid pitt plays an actress and jon pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire thats about all the story has to offer i was surprised at how bad ingrid pitts english is i guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films ive seen her innot a very memorable film or one that i would recommend to anyone but horror completists,neutral
459,spoilersi was very curious to see this film after having heard that it was clever and witty i had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom i feltthe idea behind the film would have been acceptable depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience what made me dislike the whole film were two thingsfirst of all the film was so downtoearth that it looked as if by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a daytoday basis it became itself ordinary and dullsecondly the overall sloppiness of the production with dialogues that were barely understandabletoo bad,neutral
460,if youve ever been harassed on the underground by a christian who says jesus is the answer whats the question then perhaps you should thank god if youve never met a lacanian slavoj zizek the most evangelical of lacanians would surely exchange the word jesus in that statement for lacanhegelzizeks star burns brightly at the moment no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption so it seems impressive when someone anyone comes along and says hang on films may say something about ourselvesthe ideas zizek expounds in this film are true purely because he says so for example zizek explains that three marx bros are the ego superego and id god knows what happened to zeppo or gummo perhaps theyre the sinthomeor is that movies themselves this is simply what they are in zizeks output culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology people may object that he certainly has something to say but how different is what he says from the christian attributing everything to gods willwhats wrong with taking examples from films or anywhere to illustrate theory well nothing at all as zizek seems to believe they may even serve as a proof however it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context without context you can say and prove anything you want for zizek lacan is the answer so he goes and makes an example of it everything but everything resembles the teachings of the master and culture is there to bear this out to serve this ideology for instance zizeks exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in vertigo when jimmy stewart spies on kim novak in a flower shop but in the context of the film this is not a voyeurs fantasy position at all stewart has been deliberately led there by novak this presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout zizeks two hour and a half cinematic sermonhis analysis of the baby wants to f scene in blue velvet is laughable touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific to the masculine truth of feminine jouissance zizek says that isabella rossilinis character not only demands her degradation but is unconsciously in charge of the situation this is an example of her jouissance well possibly but sorry to be prosaic where is the evidence for this in the film she partially undergoes her humiliations because hopper has kidnapped her son zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with kyle maclachalan but this may be due to any number of things isnt that the point of socalled feminine jouissance according to lacan feminine jouissance unlike phallic jouissance cannot be articulated it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language if this is right then no example can be made of it it also means that the entire concept is nonsensical and entirely mystical it can only be designated by dogmatists such as zizek theres feminine jouissance for you why is this feminine jouissance because i say so what example can really be garnered from these films only zizeks psychology why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films even to the point that when in a boat on botega bay he says he wants to f rod steiger too is this not the wishfulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films as the saying goes freud would have a field day with the perverts guide to the cinema but with zizek himself nobody elsezizeks theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws this film illustrates how zizek desires and only extremely vaguely as to be almost useless how the rest of us desire for as any psychoanalyst knows how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated and cannot be easily universalised if at all zizeks love of making everything an example of lacans answer bears this out how do we desire like this this is how i do it problem is in zizeks desire everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire but zizek is a leninist and they certainly dont like letting the subject speak for itselfthe perverts guide to the cinema is a summation zizeks love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political what dogma isnt zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis what he is trying to discover because the terms of his exploration and therefore his ethics in doing so are never put into questionzizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing hes a kind of henry ford of cultural theory massproduction and any colour as long as its black he is perfect for todays highly consumerist society supposedly critical while giving people the same cap over and over and pretending that it is something different this is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems which capitalism always claims to provide rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all which is kind of like being brain dead for me zizeks third matrix pill is a suicide capsuleps i loved zizeks solemn remark presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity that music in films can greatly affect peoples sympathies did this only occur to zizek after he watched jaws,neutral
461,an old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies you get your hitchcock your chaplin your bergman and some other stuff prior to the ies to disguise that he has no clue what is going on in cinemas these days he throws in the matrixbut its not only the same lame filmasart speech all over again this speech is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes itegosuper ego anal phase sexual insufficiency it is garnished with the cheesy effect of having zizte edited into the movies he is taking about for someone who is supposed to know much about movies his own is cinematographicly speaking yeiksto put it in zizeks own words i saw on the screen last night or in the words of a great movie makermr zizek what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you two points only and may god have mercy on your soul,neutral
462,already his first claim that desires are always artificial is totally fallaciouswhen a jehovah witness reject gets his own documentary on movies or anything for that matter its time for anyone to get their own although far far more intelligent than say paris hilton i know not too difficult zizeks mouth spews just as much baloney as hers just a different kind he combines the worst from both his professional worlds psychoanalysis and philosophy both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert bllsosopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories to rant without a beginning or end and to connect concepts almost randomly in the process misusing the english language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love example there are three main marx brothers hence what a great idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness the id the ego and the superego im kind of surprised he didnt play a clip from snowhite and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of gahannah moslem hell its like the premise of schumachers the number play with numbers long enough and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want even linking ancient greeks with princess dis deathhowever there is an entertainment element to tpgtc watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun why watch cuckoos nest or any other madhouse drama when you can have zizek for more than hours its like watching an amusing train wreck admittedly he is almost funny on one or two occasionsi have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate moviemaking into an exalted intellectual social science giving idiotic movies like birds this much thought hence this much credit probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value and the few ones that do have some intelligence dont require a shrinkturnedphilosopher to draw one a map to understand them unless one is a complete idiot zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in slovenia these dayswhen zizek showed the bathtub hole in the psycho shower scene i thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leighs blood or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leighs vagina with the blood flowing into it instead of out as in menstruation this representing some kind of clever zizekian irony speaking of which the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene and the script his movies wouldnt have been the illogical farfetched crap that they often are the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about hidden deep meanings and when you add zizeks fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated ie the easily impressionable and the gulliblezizek utters a number of unintentionally funny things here one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkinss cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with the satisfaction of work of a job well done dont laugh neither hitchcock nor the writer of psycho could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done the cleaning of a bloodstained toilet while they were conceivingdirecting that scene talk about putting words into ones dead mouth but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to sayi like zizeks initial thoughts on tarkovskys terrific solaris but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in antifeminism and other nonsense into his theoryzizeks attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone i just want to play with it all day logic has its rules and is not supposed to be raped at least not publicly by the likes of him he seems to regard logic proof commonsense and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys concepts to be either avoided twisted to fit the endgoal or simply annihilated zizek is the lsdtripped hippie and all his favorite movies are his own personal sthe fact that zizek overfocuses on two of the most overrated directors and ones whose films often lack intelligence if anything such as hitchcock and lynch only further diminishes his already low credibility i was surprised de palma didnt feature more prominently thats another lame director who writes inept scripts zizek has a field day with lynchs incomprehensible lost highway there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched itzizeks comment that the viewer readily accepts von triers laughable groundbreaking physical setup in dogville made me snicker however zizek doesnt only make up stuff as he goes along he also indulges heavily in the bleedin obvious like all social scientists an oxymoron he wraps his very trite observations into articulate if full of spitting and sometimes complex blankets of language after all sociology functions in precisely the same way it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact its what we already all know but told in an eloquent way which fools the more unobservant listeneri was halfexpecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of

463,this film is predictable it is more predictable then a vinnie testaverdi pass when he huts the ball for the jets one saw the ending coming up halfway through the film the politics reminds me when i was back east many people know when the fix is in i gave this four because of the acting but the story is lame,neutral
464,this movie had the potential to be far more than it was but it not only fails to deliver it brings up nauseous self righteous preaching at the same timejohn cusack is even flatter than he was in midnight of the garden of good and evil the difference is that this time he is supposed to have an southern accent which he noticeably loses several times each sceneal pacino does his shtick but seems to be walking through this film and collecting a paycheck hes good as usual but hardly standoutsupporting cast throw in female romantic interest which added little if anything to the story speaking of the story a convoluted who really cares tale where cusack is the selfrighteous mayors boy who just has to search for the right thing to be donepeople dont act this way cusacks character loses all credibility at the end of which without revealing it is preach and nauseous the final scene makes the penultimate silliness seem profound its also completely inaccurate but i wont get into lawthis is a bad by the numbers movie it seems interesting for the first minutes and then its really a preachy proselytizing selfrighteous film for the last hour better off with mindless crap than this pile of junk,neutral
465,admittedly i find al pacino to be a guilty pleasure he was a fine actor until scent of a woman where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably i hoped this film of which id heard almost nothing growing up would be a nice little gem an overlooked aheadofitstime intelligent and engaging citypolitical thriller its notcity hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters names and realistic citywide issues that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating that once you find out the truth it will blow your mind in truth however these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as corruption of power twofaced politicians mafia with police ties etc and theoretically this setup allows for some thrilling tension the fear that none of the characters are safe and anything could happen but again it really doesntunfortunately the only things that happen are quite predictable and were left with several confession monologues that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the real world of politics and society but after minutes of names and missing reports and a spiderweb of lies and coverups the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal i dont think were left with that in city hall and while its a very full film i dont find it altogether rich,positive
466,wow this is really not that good i would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good it is but it is nothing specialthe movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies,neutral
467,i was lured to see this movie by its starpower but ultimately thats all it delivers it plays much more like a greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption its greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense we know who the bad guys are from the beginning and just follow along as they fall like dominoes the film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex but has forgotten to substitute good clean romance or excitement in any other way all the flavor of a good flat decaffeinated diet cola qa which also takes place in new york is a far better alternative as is la confidential,positive
468,wow a movie about nyc politics seemingly written by someone who has never set foot in nyc you know theres a problem when at one moment you expect the credits to roll and the movie continues on for another half hour the characters are boring john cusacks accent is laughable and the plotline teeters between boring and laughable a horrible movie,negative
469,what a dud it began with some promise then became unfocused and wandered john cusacks cajun accent was laughable bridget fondas role existed only to get a skirt into the film and pacino did pacino his entire generation of actors nicholson hackman caine hoffman have developed a standard performance that each can deliver effortlessly or less charitably mail in in their paycheck films this was one,neutral
470,dont get me wrong the movie is beautiful the shots are stunning and the material is dramatic however it was a big disappointment and i actually left very angry at what disney had donebbcs planet earth was all of the above and more it was subtle it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death there was tragedy and triumph loss and gain it was balanceddisneys edit of earth is none of this they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about they made it dramatic they put an over the top musical score there to frighten us they made predators evil they made walruses evil they showed every encounter as negative it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded but at the expense of the lesson of balance the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about minutes of positivei am all for preventing global warning but this was over the top political and environmental junkthats another thing i went to see it on the big screen but was disappointed in the picture quality it looked better on my tv at homeif you want to see something like this and get the whole picture go out and buy rent or borrow the bbcs planet earth series it is better lessons better sound and if you have bluraybetter picture quality,neutral
471,i cant believe i am so angry after seeing this that i am about to write my first ever review on imdbthis disney documentary is nothing but a rehashed planet earth lite now i knew going into this that it was advertised as from the people who brought you planet earth but i had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary miniseries i just paid to see something i already own on dvd shame on disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here save a james earl jones voiceover and seconds of sailfish that i dont believe were in planet earthbut the biggest crime of all is that while planet earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecologic change disney took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe after the male polar bears demise they show his cubs grown significantly a year later and spew some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all no mention of the grown cubs impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured no warning of trouble for future generations if we dont get our act together nothing just a montage of stuff we have already seen throughout the movie and many times more if you are one of the billion people who have already seen planet earthi have never left the theater feeling so ashamed and cheated in my life,neutral
472,yesterday was earth day april in the us and other countries and i went to see the fullfeature movieversion of earth by disneynature i guess like the auto manufacturers disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet maybe they really do care about the planet i dont know but i dont think it warrants a special unit with the word nature in it i do know that my youngest daughter loves mickey mouse and who am i to tell a oneyear old my personal feelings about disney aside from incredible cinematography it was a typical disney disappointment for me preceded by a halfdozen disney movie trailers rife with disney clich circle of life falling with style overdramatic music recycled footage disney claims new footage i was even starting to think that james earl jones narration is getting a bit boring i like james earl jones but his work for disney and morgan freeman doing every warner brothers narrative starts to wear thin i really think that disney bought some bbc nature photography that was so spectacularly done they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable soundbites on itand what is disneys obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals there were a halfdozen such scenes complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out i think disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the actionmovie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents i was also cognizant of how disney stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think its still a controversial subject i recommend skipping this one and renting the blue planet dvds on netflix nature films seem to be best done by the british at the moment,neutral
473,i dont know why but after all the hype on npr i thought this was a new movieall the best footage has been used for bbc docs and natgeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programsit has been repackaged with sappy narration and overdramatic music for disney to take advantage of earth daythere are great moments and it is always nice to listen to darth vaderoops james earl jones speak but i had hoped for a ground breaking movie considering the new camera technology used in the making of this filmit has been sanitized for a child audience so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as koyannisquatsi sic and this movie is certainly not it,positive
474,a lot of death happens in the wild you dont need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out but does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary what is with this fascination with gruesome death do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions or a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion no less i thought this was going to be a familyfriendly nature film and why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the films trailers were the filmmakers afraid of losing moneythen in typical comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent birdsofparadise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration humanly possible it was surreal its as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a roomful of first and second graders on a school field trip wow from the mean to the moronic in a heartbeatif there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review why not focus on animals actually copulating giving birth laying eggs bathing sleeping cleaning each other socializing playing emotional displays other than fear and anger unusual behaviors like mouth brooding migration problem solving skills culture yes many animal species have what humans call culture communication skills parenting healing abilities etc in other words stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty and why not be much more wellrounded and focus on delight and inspiration instead,neutral
475,my title above says it all let me make it clearer if you have seen the bbcs planet earth which i am sure most of you have then you are not gonna like this movie too much and i own all the discs of planet earth i had seen the rating for this movie very high and read good reviews about it i was excited to check it outalas i went to the theater and the movie started i saw it was a disney movie with production companies listing bbc and discovery and when they started the first scenes about the polar bear i recognized them from my dvds at home of planet earththe movie continued and went on and on and on me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from planet earthwe were very very disappointed as i think of the footage is from planet earth i am saying because some of the scenes i didnt recognize i have a feeling that i simply didnt remember themso finally what this movie really is is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of planet earth with a narration aimed at kids yes the narration is quite kiddish let me give you an example when they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub the narrator says the polar cubs are not like human kids they dont always listen to their mothers i dont remember the exact words but this is how it is so in a nutshell this is condensed planet earth for kids,positive
476,for those whod like to see this movie id say go without the narration it might be a very good moviedocumentary but the music the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me following several animals their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap were watching but the melodramatic point of view just doesnt cut it for me moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey one exception left there the camera zooms out or skips to another scene i ask myself why that happens if they were to show reality why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains i think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd cause after all it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet,positive
477,the invisible man is a fantastic movie from a cutting edge film for its time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible go ahead take a look at the film you will be shocked that it was made in it was the first true special effects movie come computer aided special effects seem like childs play audiences are not blown away by special effects instead they are disappointed if they are not done right the special effects in hollow man the update of the hg wells story are ok but not the biggest problem with this film directed by paul verhoeven who you might remember from showgirls and total recall kevin bacon plays sebastian caine a scientist dabbling in the world of bioinvisibilation yeah i know thats not a word but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the teams funding so as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation yeah i know i used that nonword again process the process has dire consequences no caine does not die but instead becomes a horny violent creature aka a guy now that hes invisible caine stalks a sexy neighbor a coworker former girlfriend linda elisabeth shue and the man who took away his funding then a funny thing happens caine becomes a new supernatural being the thing that wont die laughing in the face of all things natural caine faces down death and spits in its face as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die dragging the ending of the movie out the movie is silly stupid and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used sometimes not there are neat possibilities in hollow man but of course not one of them is explored for a more interesting look at an invisible being get ready for some good oldfashioned black and white cinema and check out the invisible man kevin bacon will still be invisible when you come back probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano,neutral
478,one could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case the story the characters and finally the entire last minutes of the film are about as fresh as a madscientist flick from the early s there are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets but alas soon were back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematicthere has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past years and some of them have their charms but its becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven who does have his moments is a very bad one it is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as a result hollow man is seriously undermined with clichs sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoeverhowever the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing when making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex is very toned down when the whole world blows up the good guys go oh darn and oh my god hollow man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them im not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears i think we can thank verhoeven for that,positive
479,i get to the cinema every week or so and regularly check out this site but never before have i felt compelled to comment on a filmto my all time list of shockingly bad films last man standing spawn the bone collector i can now add the drivel that was hollow manfrom the awful opening titles a ridiculously overlong run through of cast and crew put together with alphabetti spaghetti through to the insulting finale a world record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to have ever made it to cinema this film is dismal and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking out long before the endthis isnt just my opinion it was that of my friends and everyone around us when large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller its clear that the film is hopelessnot only that it was sick too the director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked bmovie its difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man because the extent of the invisible mans forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a blokes mind if made invisible but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved it hardly makes entertaining cinemaspoilers followget past the films sick exterior and things are even worse whilst kevin bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as hollow man the rest of them perhaps handicapped by a dire script do an even better job of being hollow cast one long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man hes finally snapped shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion this is par for the course and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting they pad their way through the lab corridors terrified guns poised but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague the lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after hes insulted and abused her and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts even after he drowns the pentagon chief he drowned in his pool last night reports the same female spectacularly failing to put two and two togetherthe script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue and the rest is just an az of film cliches which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the endthe eureka moment at the computer the female undressing at the window the looped security video the list really is endless the predictable disregard for strength in numbers the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of probable impending death and leave them to their own devices the almostdead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes the falling lift which just stops before hitting them and more than anything else the immortality of the bad guythe invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flamethrower electrocuted whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors and then having apparently survived the explosion fireball and total destruction of the labs has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watchesthat this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near saving this one which should be avoided at all costs,neutral
480,some spoilers as if you wouldnt know how itll endmy expectations for hollow man were high a very good commercial a director like paul verhoeven and actors like kevin bacon and elisabeth shue plus a very interesting theme invisibility every premise for a great movie was accomplished unfortunately these things didnt matter at all the movie was very very week without suspense and awfully predictable its all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility after the tests on animals succeeded kevin bacon decides to test it on himself once hes invisible he changes completely realizing the advantages of not being seen from this to murder theres a very thin linehollow man is an ill movie it suffers of the disease that many new movies have the special effects from a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects without giving a damn about the real value of the movie i must admit the fx are awesome probably the best i have seen since matrix but thats not enough to make a movie good actually thats the problem with the movies today just like verhoeven most directors care only about spectacular scenes and nothing more the exceptions are very few and probably the matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plotafter starship troopers verhoeven disappoints again in stead of a great film hm is crp there are only reasons why you could watch this movie the special effects the joke with superman and wonder woman i wont spoil this moment for youokay so what went wrong with the movie everything lets see what i can remember its not tensed at all it shouldve been but its not its too predictable you know from the beginning who will die and who will live in stead of focusing on the psychological part verhoeven cares only about the effects very many cliches of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dying just like in every low quality horror the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible every time there is somebody alone in the lab perfect victim for bacon some holes in the plot example at the beginning bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab after hes invisible how can he do that the ending absolutely horrible after shue hits bacon in the head bacon falls down to the ground then shue and brolin leave quietly and slowly without looking back is that normal then bacon gets up attacks them they kill him again and then shue screams i heard an explosion happened minutes ago and they suddenly run inside didnt she hear that explosion some time before theres a scene in which you can see the microphones hanging above the actors come on mr verhoeven i expected much more from youso thats about hollow man what was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam vote out of for the special effects,positive
481,leave it to paul sex on the brain verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the invisible man story if hed direct a pokemon film im sure hed turn it into some massive orgy of sorts i dont mind sex or even sleaze check my other reviews on film but frankly its obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldnt see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it its a shame because it could have been good if the film didnt spend so much time having an invisible kevin bacon grope women the game cast of actors does what it can with the onenote cheesy script but i felt bad for some of them including william devane who is totally wasted herebut then what could i have expected from the director of showgirls which btw is much more entertaining than this stilted bad film,neutral
482,going into this movie you know that this is movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac so right away youre guessing who will live and who will die the survivors end up being exactly who youd expect them to be so no points for plot twists thereand if youre not sure if this is a bmovie or a movie that just happens to take place in a lab with an engaging story william devane plays a part instant bmovie statusthe movie is promising in the beginning at the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla who is becoming increasingly violent oooh foreboding the best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again great special effects same thing when they make bacon invisiblethere are a couple of bare breasts a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing to give this movie an rrating that it really didnt needfor a thriller there werent really any surprises except when shue makes like macgyver in the freezer which is more of a whaaaa ok there is one surprise thats when caine bacon comes back one last time in the elevator shaft it was a surprise but only because youre yelling at tv noooo youre dead already end the movie speaking of yelling at the tvthats all i did for the last minutes or so put on your fing goggles instead of putting their infrared goggles on so that they can see him they try every other trick in the book fire extinguishers sprinkler systemsthe story really lost it at the end but the special effects were good thats the only reason i give it a,positive
483,this is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression story writing is what movie making is about incredible visual effects very good acting especially from shue everything is perfect except the story is just poor and so everything failspicture this if you had the power to be invisible what would you do well our mad scientist here played by kevin bacon could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women this is all his supposedly genius mind could think of does he try to gain extra power no he doesnt even bother research a way to get back to being visible the guy is basically a sex crazed maniacadd to that the lab atmosphere you have all these young guys throwing around jokes like they were in a bar if it wasnt for all the white coats and equipment you would think this is a bad imitation of cheers very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the hollow mans wolfeven as a thriller the movie falls way short because most of the thrilling scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming this is just a stupid thing i have to do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill meif you read the actual book while the scientist cane goes after women there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character in the movie cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it just sad,neutral
484,within the realm of science fiction two particular themes consistently elicit interest were initially explored in the literature of a precinematic era and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike with varying degrees of success the first theme that of time travel has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film as well as the written word most recently on the screen with yet another version of the hg wells classic the time machine the second theme which also manages to hold audiences in thrall is that of invisibility which sparks the imagination with its seemingly endless and myriad possibilities and this theme too has again become the basis for a film adapted from another hg wells classic the invisible man the realization of which here is hollow man directed by paul verhoeven and starring kevin bacon and elisabeth shuesebastian caine bacon and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the us government exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility which they have at last achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method they have in fact progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original visual state of being its a problem however that caine after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab has solved or so he thinks and when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful he decides to present the results to the board of directors in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the projectat the last minute though caine demurs fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level the testing of a human subject and he takes it upon himself to become that subject securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that theyve been given approval by the board to do so but something goes wrong and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before its too late it all begins to take a toll on caines mind and suddenly his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that now theres a very real chance that he may lose everything including himselfverhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting even thought provoking film he establishes a good pace and uses the fx at his disposal to great effect though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development anyone familiar with the invisible man or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story will know early on that caine is not destined for happier times still verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience but he seems bent on rushing toward the climax and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless bloodandgore fest that betrays his audience and everything hes worked for earlier in the film rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to caines suffering and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to its inevitable conclusion verhoeven takes the low road and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind along with anything that would have made this a memorable film and its a shame because verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lowerkevin bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable if only on the surface which seemingly serves verhoevens purposes perfectly theres little depth to bacons portrayal but it has more to do with his directors agenda than his own acting abilities verhoeven simply does not allow bacon the time to develop caine to any extent the character is mainly a vessel around which verhoeven can build his story and toward that end it works the film would have been better served however had verhoeven and bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part something that would have drawn them in a bit rather than leaving them at the gate as it were as mere observers of an fx laden extravaganzaelisabeth shue comports herself well in the role of linda mckay caines willing accomplice in the illfated experiment but its basically a thankless part that offers little challenge especially to an actor of shues caliber the same can be said of kim dickens so magnificent in the film things behind the sun her character sarah kennedy does little more than support the action and fx both actors are capable of so much more and deserve better than what they are given to work with herethe supporting cast includes josh brolin matthew greg grunberg carter joey slotnick frank mary randle janice and william devane dr kramer entertaining to a point and even successful on a certain low level hollow man is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been like an annual fireworks display it will give you some momentary thrills but after awhile itll begin to blend in with all the others youve seen without anything special to set it apart and its too bad because given the talent and abilities of those involved here it could have been so much more i rate this one,positive
485,i dont normally feel much of an incentive to comment on films i dont like but in a case like this one i just have to say something this movie is terrible illogical and stupid there are so many flaws in the storytelling that i dont even feel obliged to elaborate on because its time for me to move on from this experience the most annoying point is however that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for bacons characters madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his conditiongranted the special effects are impressive and in the past paul verhoeven has done some good stuff the directors cut of robocop on dvd is great however this movie is stupid and generally doesnt come near to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject matter and instead settles for predictable action without any enjoyment in short as many other reviews here say wish i had read them before stay away from this film,neutral
486,unfortunately one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate clichd screenplay hollow man is a rather useless filmpractically everything seen here has been done to death the characters the idea and the action sequences especially the lift shaft with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects however it is just the same special effect done over and over again and by the end of the film that has been done to death also i was hoping before watching hollow man that the invisible man theme which is hardly original in itself would be the basis of something newer and more interesting this is not so it isnt long before the film turns into an overlyfamiliar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics the mound of clichs piles up so fast that its almost impressiveon top of all this kevin bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best good points might be a passable jerry goldsmith score but no competition for his better efforts a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects i was tempted to give this film three out of ten but the effects push hollow mans merit up one notch,positive
487,paul verhoeven finally bombed out on this one he became a joke on himself once again we have a film which includes sex and violence immorality leering at women and lots of attitiude talk between the characters and dollying pansits all for nothing because their is no action at all in this film it fudges all its set pieces all the actors give the kind of performances form a verhoeven film in other words rampant over acting on almost every level starship troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world the characters inhabited in this scientists are acting the same way sorry paul but soldiers and scientist are not really made of the same mindsetone major flaw in the plot was that after escaping for that one night to do evil things kevin bacons character then returns back to the science lab where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated manniquens elizabeth shue excepted walk and talk why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world how could they possibly track him if he could be anywhere at all think os all the different things that could have been done with this concept both in terms of story and characterisation then look at what this film does and you really how badly done and concieved the whole project really wasmore insulting is the doco on the dvd where everyone is claiming that verhoeven is some kind of mad genius well one out of two isnt that badthis film has nothing of note in it just like the title sayshollow,neutral
488,other than some neat special effects this movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting but with no success kevin bacons acting was pretty good but he couldnt salvage the movies lack of plot,positive
489,i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen most of this movie since its been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but im usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir im not sure why perhaps its that i dont want kevin bacon to be evil and theres disappointment in that but i think its witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of perhaps if they are mature,neutral
490,the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear sadly they stopped there they should have continued to make the script disappear then the silly set and finally every visible element of this film because theres nothing else there to showgary thompson and andrew marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film i dont really think they exist i think they bought this script at scriptsrus where you buy a standard blank monster movie script and just fill in the blanks theres a monster stalking us lets split up they actually lets split up in this movie hit aliengiantbugmonsterinvisibleman with crowbar not dead yet burn hugerabbitsharkinvisibleman in unsurvivable fire not dead yet you know the standard stuff even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie ir glasses spraying with something like paint were handled badly what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie they psychological issues for the subject the deterioration of the mind due to the process treating an invisible subject and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than seconds and would have been far more interesting had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end it would have been a much better movie all in all it stunki would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie but i dont want to do any spoilers suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they dont think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than,neutral
491,this movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects there are some interesting visualsaside from that its typical ninetiesaughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance true to the titleits not worth picking apart the story thats like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur theres not much there to begin with its nothing original and not very special so dont go in for the story at all just look at the effectsas has been mentioned it got a little flashy at the end diluting the purity of great fx treatment of an invisible and at times half invisible man however if you ignore the standard pyrotechnics its a sight to behold or not to beholdall in all its a decent fx film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone,positive
492,shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role elizabeth shue is a commendable actress why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity i must give credit where credit is due though some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin bacons character sebastian caine i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone man or woman that has any form of selfrespect to account for,negative
493,another violent angry fantasy from paul verhoeven verhoeven is a puzzle its difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion he also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world and this has some outstanding ones cannot hide a negligence to story dialogue and performance kevin bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side the river wild in an attempt to offset his boyish looks given the material however bacon isnt nearly hateful enough to compel the other principals are elisabeth shue and josh brolin neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who when forced to deliver inane dialogue embarrass themselves the climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended,neutral
494,to describe this film as garbage is unfair at least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby this flick was neither absorbing nor entertainingkevin bacon can act superbly given the chance so no doubt had an irs bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay the mad scientist story of hollow man has been told before been told better and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effectsmost of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies in the uk they were marketed as the transparent man womandog which is maybe where they got the title for this filmclever special effects dire script nonexistent plot,positive
495,thats what i found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept rd act of this sorry excuse for a film first off the computer effects are absolutely mindblowing those computer wizs really deserve a pat on the back the rest of the movie thoughnone of the characters act in a realistic manner especially in the aforementioned despicable rd act i promise i wont give it away but trust me its not worth keeping a secret a lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally like when they try to explain that an invisible mans eyelids dont work please give the viewers more credit than thatsome of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting what would you do after all if you were invisible no one could catch you these issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic the invisible man from there is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous and is not mentioned once later on if more attention had been paid it kevin bacons mad scientist might have made a little more sense the movie would actually be much more successful as a porno since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner but this piece of work go see something else or dont and live with the consequences,positive
496,i rarely make these comments but i felt compelled to spare others the pain i endured in watching this movie its so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply cant suspend disbelief the problem starts early when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle overlooking the capitol building in washington dc that kind of life on a government salary hah it only gets worse toward the end when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die in order to cleanse the gene pool the special effects are pretty good any producers money can buy that and the lead actors have been great in other films but the screenplay and direction here are moronic many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind paul verhoevens previous facially stupid movies showgirls starship troopers but this movie should stop the wondering hes just plain bad,neutral
497,this picture started out with good intentions bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility and shue is cute as usual in her role it all falls apart after that its your typical hollywood thriller now filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore minus any kind of humour wit or soul in other words dont waste your time watching this get the audiocassette tape with john delancie as the invisible man instead also starring leonard nimoy now that was good and hg wells is well served unlike with this mess,positive
498,cmon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode its just an old s tv show this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe yeoman barrows ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stagesthis use of an outdoor location and babe gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar showexcept a few notable exceptions ie the city on the edge of forever assignment earth and tomorrow is yesterday the old series of star trek needs to be seriously mothballed and put out of its boring misery half a dozen good episodes from is quite a poor batting averagethis is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on he actually made a lot of rubbish he doesnt deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for examplejust look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view they used wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels you can clearly see the folds in the paper every expense spared or what,neutral
499,okay now what the hell is this supposed to be is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of spielbergs close encounters of the third kind or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as when dinosaurs ruled the earth and the lost world perhaps its an intellectual philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend yes that must be it whatever it is the creators of the day time ended good old john bud cardos of kingdom of the spiders and writer david schmoeller of tourist trap must have been sniffing quite a lot glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres the story doesnt make the slightest bit of sense and the narrative structure is incoherent as hell but hey who cares as long as its got papiermch dinosaurs miniature spacecrafts headacheinducing light laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas the voiceover introduction is practically inaudible but no worries as its all gibberish did you know that the definition of time isnt what we all think it is time doesnt necessarily pass by chronologically it is one giant paradox words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us i have absolutely no idea what all this means but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tapdancing midget aliens and wellmannered dinosaurs on screen together i deliberately say wellmannered dinosaurs because at a certain point one of the prehistoric monsters politely knocks on the front door before menacing his targets the crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solarpowered house in the middle of nowhere grandpa is extremely annoying the granddaughter even more granny is a walking talking advertisement billboard for plastic surgery the youngest son strangely resembles prince valiant and the young mother is incredibly hot chris mitchum for some reason also pointless wanders around the filming sets as the hot mommys husband on business travel the special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable i sincerely hope that the other reviewer who talked about excellent special effects was being sarcastic but the absolute most genius aspect here are the dialogs just read this wondrous example of extraordinary writing grandpa you know what this is dont you this is a timespace warpstevie im not quite sure if i know what that means dadgrandpa well i guess nobody really does make up your mind gramps do you know what it is or dont you and stop talking about the vortex like youre some kind of expert in the field the day time ended is an incredibly childish and notworthbotheringfor fantasy movie though i can totally understand that some of its fans cherish the film because they saw it at young age and became fascinated with the flamboyant effects the ending completely comes out of nowhere like they suddenly ran out of money or like the effects of the mushrooms they were eating wore out unexpectedly,neutral
500,i saw this when it was in the theater it started out so strong i mean back in this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent at the time now you would have to of been at least or so in to really understand this point because studying film historically misses the mind set at the time the expectations and other related psychological factors now as i said the movie was engaging suspenseful and very entertaining it builds to an excellent climax then it ends i mean the person that described it as having a water balloon break in your hand before throwing it besides being a very poetic description in my experience it was just not strong enough my wife and i were well how can i say this we were upset i mean we paid money invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent we both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not raise enough to finish it correctly in fact my wife said it best it did not end it just stopped,positive
501,when i ordered this from blockbusters website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was who knows maybe id forgotten to take my add meds that day i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon donned in their late sstyle wide collars bellbottoms and feathered hair i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpsterthe first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe forcing polyester and pornoquality music on the wouldbe viewer from the opening scene with the poorlydone effects to the monsters from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of the vagina monologuesthroughout the film the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear the ship was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path of course if moved slower than bob barkers impacted bowels but it had menacing pencilthin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two with some assistancemoving on as the weirdness and bell bottoms continue we found out that theyre caught in a space time warp how do we garner this little nugget of scientific information because the oldest male lead tells his son that in a more or less offthecuff fashion like reminiscing about how you won the big game over a cup of joe or an icecold bottle of refreshing cocacola was pops a scientist nope but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and einsteins theoriesthe recording i watched on dvd was almost bootleg quality the sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone other than that it was really really really bad theres not enough reallys to describe it reallyi know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics i never saw this film on its original release but even back then i think i wouldve come to the same conclusion bury this one quick,negative
502,i cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema so after watching the trailer for water lilies i expected to like this film because i thought id stumbled on something unique a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love sort of a female version of beautiful thing the main characters are young french women years old marie is slender reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way floriane is outgoing athletic and beautiful and anne is loyal pudgy and behaviorally immature the erotic interrelationship between marie and floriane is always simmering in this movie if not at the surface then just below it water lilies however is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens it is about sexual frustration suffering ennui teens working at crosspurposes and in at least two instances joyless mechanical sex it also proves that screenwriters and filmmakers mar their own creations when they become too manipulativein the extra features on the lord of the flies dvd director peter brook says french cynicism starts with the arousal of sex meaning the french regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism part of the downfall of this film is filmmaker celine sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicismwhere is the joy i asked myself while watching this film yes first love can be painful and frustrating but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh lifeaffirming way these positive aspects are missing from this movie there is no balanceorganically this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love but sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film first what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude i know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in european cinema as evidenced by films like the slingshot the rascals the devil probably the little thief murmur of the heart friends beau pere and europa europa but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion see audience i can make a film where i show only the unattractive person nude either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity wouldve been an honest way to gothere is a scene in a club where floriane and marie are dancing what follows next is not just floriane cynically manipulating marie it is filmmaker sciamma cynically manipulating her audienceperhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when floriane warns marie shes about to request something that is not normal marie understandably asks who cares about being normal then sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie because florianes request is a phony derivative and substitute question not the authentic heartfelt question the movie maries character and the viewers whove invested their time deserve here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewers nerves since when do the french of all people take baths wearing bathing suits and with a turtle to boot what teen of any nationality would chomp down on an apple core thats been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloveds mouththe three main actresses are promising and if they find better vehicles for their talents may become excellent actors louise blachere anne is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles adele haenel floriane could become a leading lady or a bombshell or both pauline acquart marie possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable in the future she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaimall in all water lilies was very disappointing will an honest filmmaker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love no not necessarily for the sake of this middleaged guy but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with and yes to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema,positive

505,for the first couple of seasons i thought the apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show the combination between reality tv and a week jobinterview was innovative and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too out therethe new season is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business at all in the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the businessrelated tasks now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do everything to keep them on the show that means lying trashtalking backstabbing etc the boardroom can be entertaining to watch but its entertainment at its lowpoint sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old jerry springer episode the tasks on the show are at most boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay nbc for the publicity and what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season that is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in reallife i have absolutely no respect for any of the contestants this season they all seem like idiots to me in earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show it also seems like donald trumps massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest i cant see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him his rationality in the boardroom mostly doesnt make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what its worthrip the apprentice please nbc for gods sake get the show off the air as soon as possible its just too embarrassing to watch the apprentice was once a great tvshow but now its just a big fat joke,neutral

509,one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film ascript existed that made any sense was the rough cut hourslong and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives why would anyone finance this mess i will say that tomwlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he canwith the dialogue and dramatic situations he is given butcharacters come and go for no apparent reason continuity isnonexistent and the acting cinematography and direction are toput it politely amateurish not one sleeps is an unfortunatechoice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyoneactually attempt to actually watch this film,neutral
510,jochen hick wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the aids virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant nonprejudicial infective organismstefan tom wlaschiha journeys from berlin to san francisco to investigate his fathers scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused he meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from puccinis opera turandot which just happens to be opening at the san francisco opera a police investigator louise tolliver irit levi and her companion cop kalene parker follow the murders while stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in san francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his fathers theory he encounters a strange lad jeffrey jim thalman with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent doctor burroughs richard conti who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects how this all come to an end is the play of the film a story as much about the search for self identity between stefan and jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murderswhile tom wlaschiha jim thalman and richard conti do well with their roles they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented irit levy and kaylene parker when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero there are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of nessun dorma as sung by mario del monaco from a recording o the opera and that seems to be the reason for making the film good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing grady harp february,neutral

512,i dont give much credence to aids conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized in the early years of the aids epidemic the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demimonde of san francisco the city renowned for its beauty has rarely appeared uglier than in this film a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scenewhile the acting and plot cant be said to be welldone the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss actually i found the most interesting performance to be irit levi as a crusty and cynical jewish lesbian police detective shes interesting though not necessarily convincinghighlights the films use of the garishly tragic turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist ron athey,positive

514,the good earth is perhaps the most boring film ive seen in my life the plot is slow and lacking the acting is borderline comical while i love paul muni i can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice the only saving grace i found with this film is its production value the use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment also the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time other than the production value i can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film,positive
515,the good earth is not a great film by any means it is way to ordinary maybe it was different in the s but who would want to see the life of a farmer it is not very interesting to me yes luis rainer and paul muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act in short wang lung muni a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds the film does a complete going from one generation to the next also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis,positive
516,a couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in china wang lung paul muni buys olan his future wife who becomes his slave luis rainer american stars appear in the leading roles talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology a good wife many children and land are the best things for men to have they are seen as property and investment because it is a big budget movie in which many extras cooperate big sets are built and special effects take place the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors luise rainer won an academy award for this performance which is definitely the worst in the movie her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience olan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with on the other hand paul muni gives a better performance showing his talent ones again another problem with the movie is the ending it seems like franklin did not know when to end the picture this film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of chinese culture and traditions,positive
517,luise rainer received an oscar for her performance in the good earth unfortunately her role required no she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film luises character was a slave then given away to marriage to paul munis character he did a fantastic job for his performance set in ancient asia both actors were not asian but were very convincing in their roles i hope that paul muni received an oscar for his performance because that is what luise must have gotten her oscar for she must have been a breakthrough actress one of the first to method act this seems like something that hollywood does often al pacino has played an italian and cuban i felt luises performance to be lackluster throughout and when she died she did not change in expression from any previous scenes she stayed the same throughout the film she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice if her brilliant acting was so subtle i suppose i did not see it,positive
518,well im probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site but the good earth is one of the worst structured films ive seen in a long time we have a and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one the first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine they have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended yeah ok with this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it you would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film however the film then continues on for a whole other hour and in this remaining time its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers oh yea and the age old money is the root of all evil blah blah blah just because you know your making an epic film doesnt mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to also the main idea i would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasnt even cared about through most of the film oh wait and the film isnt the only thing thats poorly written the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense she complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and yadda yadda yadda then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery even if they are starving at the time of this idea it still doesnt make sense when minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again there are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to the only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography the land is shot beautifully oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say one last thing i know that at this point in time hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything for most of the film paul muni does portray an asian man to the best of his ability but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old italian paul they even cut his hair so he looks like tony from scarfacealso a better film than this of all the main characters in the film i think maybe three are actually asian the rest are just americans being silly oh and please ms rainer that was a really nice one note performance not if i could i rip the oscar out of your hands oh i would the good earth is one epic waste of time if you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get the grapes of wrath a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets mainly because it wasnt written by a monkey,positive
519,the good earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in china the movie is based on the novel by pearl s buck the story is great but i hated that they decided to cast anglos in the lead roles walter connolly is laughable as the farmers father he has such a heavy american accent as do most of the lead actors that i could not bear listening to him speakit is a shame that hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast asians in the lead roles to take anglos and make them look like chinese is akin to anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play africanamericans,neutral

524,this movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie the main character was decently done and i felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of backstory however everything else sucks the director emmanuel is quite incompetent at filmmaking he uses some of the most idiotic shots ever a couple of random sequences of random images dispersed throughout the film i dont know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic but he wasnt it was stupid random shots of the trailer the main character lived in random buildings random pan shots of buildings random cat which walks away wtf and clouds lots of gloomy dark clouds he really liked this technique of having a scene cut up into different shots rather than being just one continuous shot ex guy is trying to light his weed and the camera circles around him instead of just one shot he edits it into like different shots so its really edgy and hip and smart stupidthe acting is horrible but its what makes the movie so funny and the scarecrow is a gymnast cause he flips and spins and twirls all the time and some of the deaths could have been better you expect the main bully to have a long well built up death but nope a simple corncob in the ear the love interest was hot voluptuous which is why this movie gets a,neutral
525,oh dear lord this movie it was horrible i am a huge fan of horror movies and most of the time horror movies other people say are bad i like the actor who played scarecrow was amazing i will say that but this plot was awful it made no sense it had way too much gore and an unnecessary and revolting sex scene at the beginning i do believe the director was trying to be shocking or whatnot but it just came out awful to add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot the actors besides scarecrow were awful and i cared so little about them that i soon forgot who was who in conclusion this movie made me sick if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway please do,negative

527,with all the excessive violence in this film it couldve been nc but the gore couldve been pg and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass badhairdewed boy friend there was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people the violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this almost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off but the teacher who called him white trash and hoodlum though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum not even close i know hoods and am part hood they dont draw in class they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher the teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters but was just stabbed in the back there were two suspenseful scenes in the film but didnt last long enough to be scary at all as i said the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off if the gore was actually fun to see then it wouldve been nc two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines his stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach though i wouldve liked to see that the acting was pathetic characters were losers and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts i suggest renting this movie for the death scenes i wont see it again anytime soon but i enjoyed the excessive violence also dont bother with the sequel i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death it sounds good but isnt the original scarecrow actually kept me interested,neutral
528,the director states in the behindthescenes feature that he loves horror movies he loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to dario argento as well as other notable directors such as george a romero and tobe hooper basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sht for mothers day the first thing they did wrong was the casting cast people that can act also dont cast a person that is years old for the role of a misunderstood year old recluse thats right hes been in high school for years the reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn haha get it and his girlfriend just goes ohmy god the scarecrow himself is quite a character doing flips off cars and calling people losersthe movie does have one redeeming factor oh wait no it doesntif you absolutely must see this movie than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the dvd it covers about everything and has a really gnarly song dude,positive
529,scarecrow is set in the small american town of emerald grove where high school student lester dwervick tim young is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers fellow students alike the poor kid suffers daily humiliation bullying teasing general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers unfortunately he doesnt find much support at home since his mom is a slut after lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field strangles the poor kid however something magical happens no the film doesnt suddenly become good lesters spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him made his life hellcowritten coproduced directed by emmanuel itier who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr duforq although i dont remember any character of this name i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of its terrible reputation i have to say it pretty much well deserved since its terrible the script by itier bill cunningham jason white uses the often told story of one of lifes losers who gets picked upon tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick weve seen it all before weve seen killer scarecrows before weve seen faceless teens being killed off onebyone before weve seen one of lifes losers get his revenge before weve seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before weve seen incompetent small town sheriffs make matters even worse before the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether its any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level the answer is a resounding no to be honest the film has terrible characters awful dialogue an inconsistent predictable story it has some cheesy oneliners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he asks can you dig it the socalled twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isnt that exciting the kills are forgettable you know im still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed killed with a stick of corndirector itier doesnt do a particularly good job here the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means theres never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off also im not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these backflips somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in the matrix or some japanese kungfu flick to give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad oneliners twirl around a bit dont you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring i know hes a killer scarecrow but i still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day theres no nudity the gore isnt anything to write home about theres a decapitation someones face is burnt someone is killed with a stick of corn someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat some sickles are stuck in peoples heads someone has their heart ripped out someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouthwith a supposed budget of about this was apparently shot in days well at least they didnt waste any time on unimportant things like story character development technically this is pretty much point shoot hope for the best stuff if you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing the acting sucks the guy who played lesters mums bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous dont get me started on his accentscarecrow has a few fun moments the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special makeup effects but as a whole the film is poorly made badly acted silly too predictable very cheesy if you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out scarecrows not to be confused with the gene hackman al pacino film scarecrow or the upcoming horror flick scarecrow which is currently in production scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels scarecrow slayer scarecrow gone wild,neutral
530,this movie is so aggrivating the main character looks like hes and ive seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy the plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor factoralso some of the worst dialogue ive heard in years lets go find a small animal to tortureughi cant even continue dont watch this pile of garbage it was made in daysthe one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures out of unwatchable,negative
531,holy this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with i tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen i rank this well below anything i have ever watched on film or tv and thats saying something i once witnessed a cow crap in a field i watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half who knows it might have moved or something well that was time better spent than watching this tripe the acting was nonexistent the plot was somewhere other than on this film i think i saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to portland in hopes of becoming a steven king shier please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs its pretty clear he needs heavy medication and id willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal bah i cant give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this chilton on the rack walk to your car start the engine then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you cant feel your bones vibrate anymore be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway you might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourselfby the way i watched this after a buddy of mine sent his girlfriend over so i could see it he dint come over she had too whats worse is that she had to watch this thing twice i heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month i hope it was because of this film,neutral
532,i saw this not too long ago and i must say this movie is terrible i watch crappy movies for fun scarecreow is not fun scarecrow is stupid you have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victimsactually worse than the one contained in this sentence he has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings everyone picks on me the only girl that thinks im not trailertrash likes one of the guys that pick on me i want to kill everybody wah ok im exaggerating but the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy moviesadding to what i just said the kids mom is promiscuous he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on moms boyfriend tells him to leave kid refuses insisting that he isnt going to leave his own house boyfriend chases kid into corn field he kills kid right in front of mom mom screams in terror boyfriend is like omg i didnt mean to then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it kid was killed under a scarecrow though so like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance his victims havent been stalked like this before scarecrows official tag lineto make matters worse this movie was filmed in a whopping days thats right days i was going to give this movie a because in spite of itself it has one or two redeeming moments theyre spoilers so i wont spoil it for you if you actually want to see this crap i could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting the horrible special effects the abysmal script and the bad camera work but i simply have no respect for lack of effort on that levelthis movie isnt nearly as good as im making it out to be if you want to see an example of how not to make a movie or if you enjoy watching bad movies like i do then watch this at your own risk everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times,neutral
533,wow is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it trust me watch iti laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny i cant believe they superimposed the school sign i must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time if a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies even the costume was bad it looked like my year old cousin could have done a better job on making it heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out just not like this one,positive
534,perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films i ever did see ill start with the bad points of t he movie which pretty much covers the entire film first of all something no one can avoid terrible acting i swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked secondly badunconvincing character workdevelopment you hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here all you figure is that they deserved it one way or another the scarecrows character was overdone and a cheap ripoff of the other great fantasy killers such as freddy or pinhead next bad dialog the scarecrow was full of horrid oneliners that would make you laugh only because it was so terrible lines like lets go find some small animals to torture really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised last but not least next off bad casting how old was the guy who played lester like the back of his head was balding for gods sake there is much more i could say about this film like its cheap special effects its high school film class effort but the point is understood its just bad film making at its worst as for what i found to be good in the movie entertaining for those with low low low standards would help put insomniacs to sleep a very cheap laugh or even a giggle,neutral
535,first off let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie this entire movie had to have been a dare you know like dude i bet you couldnt make the worst movie ever with this movie theyve made a good effort at achieving that title the effects are of course poor the plotdialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every b horror movie ever made the actors im assuming are supposed to be in college yet parts of it especially at the beginning make it seem like theyre supposed to be in high or middle school it makes no sense the scarecrow going around killing people isnt the least bit enjoyable spoiler at the end when they chant lesters name and he reappears the black guy and scarecrow are both laughing probably out of relief they were on their last scene and at the cheesy dialogue,neutral
536,lets face it some lame kid who dies and has his soul transfered into a scarecrow das no gonna happen neva omfg this stupid loser kid who cant stand up for himself gets his ass handed to him by some drunk bastard screwing his mom right as he dies he looks up at the scarecrow and he lets his spirit go into the scarecrow the drunk guy covered up his death by making it seem suicidal and thought he had gotten away with it we later see he is tossed out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow they had a brief encounter which includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow rebounding with takes one to know one loser the scarecrow flips off the building calls him daddyo and then beheads the poor man we can see how this awesome movie unfolds from that he goes on to kill many people afterward he mainly kills the people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes off to kill some random ass people just for some laughs no laughing here he adds a punchline to every kill too every time he killed someone he would do some karate flips and finish it all off with one of his signature punchlines in the case of someone who was hard of hearing he would say here have an ear of corn then shove it up their ass or we can actually take an example from the movie he just got done killing a cop and was on his way to killing the only person who ever stood up for him her father the sheriff yelled to the madman to stop and he said hey stay awhile and threw a dagger threw his chest and stuck him onto some tree in the end of the movie he killed two guys and threw in the punchline gotta split and killed two guys by shoving a scythe into their heads wowzors this movie made me want to cream my pants so bad maybe next time this guy makes a movie it wont be gay,negative
537,ive gotta say i usually like horror movies that ive never seen however this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste im used to the gory gut wrenching types but this particular movie was lame the acting was horrible yet the corny no pun intended oneliners were cute and the sequel to it scarecrow slayer was even worse yes probably when it first came out there was a huge rave about it and people liked it but when movies like the ring and the exorcist of emily rose come out movies like these make movies like scarecrow seem childish if you want a movie to just pass the time pick this one the special effects are cheesy as heck but seeing that it was a low budget movie i can kind of see where that would come in this will kind of remind you of the movie children of the corn independent movies rock most of the time so if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs or in the sequel scarecrows going at it then these movies would be for you,neutral
538,im watching this on the scifi channel right now its so horrible i cant stop watching it im a videographer and this movie makes me sad i feel bad for anyone associated with this movie some of the camera work is good most is very questionable there are a few decent actors in the flick too bad theyre surrounded by what must have been the directors relatives thats the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie music was a little better than the acting if you get around to watching this i hope its because there was absolutely no other option the sequel yes sequel is coming on nowi think ill skip it jason,negative
539,wow what can i say about this film its a lousy piece of crap im surprised that it got rated as high as it did whats wrong with this film heres a better question whats not wrong with this filmthe story itself is just crap and clich heres pretty much what its aboutsome kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on gets killed and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge all of that is packed into minutes of worthless film if you havent seen this movie dont waste your time watching it also the second one isnt much better so dont bother watching that eitheri rated this movie a three because i liked the scarecrows outfit not because there was anything good about the movie i think you get the picture,neutral
540,a far as bmovies go scarecrow is one of those that are so bad that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through a lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck he then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him apparently the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers this scarecrow aside from having a snappy oneliner for each of his victims can also do matrixlike flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight also why did he always look like a rotted corpse just like the two needless sequels that followed this this isnt even worth a laugh,negative
541,okay enjoy is a pretty relative term but flexibility is in order when youre dealing with a filmmaker of james glickenhaus calibremcbain is truly one of the most ridiculous over the top action films ive ever seen without the nasty edge of the exterminator other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the films heroic middle aged commandos but how about making a film in the philippines that is set in colombia all the extras are filipino in fact the only character who looks remotely hispanic is good ol victor argo as the much reviled el presidente oh yes we also have maria conchita alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader there are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of american imperialism,positive
542,i purchased this film on the cheap in a sale having read the back of the dvd case and assuming that either way i cant lose it if was rubbish then no loss if it was any good then bargainthen i watched iti am normally a fan of christopher walken but in this film he commanded very little screen presence seeming not to do a whole lot even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the action in the plot seems to affect him very little and his eventual revenge is just boring and undramaticnormally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and snare them into feeling something for the characters however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused and almost random events that loosely tied together towards its eventual conclusionat this point i wepti thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing i have ever been subjected to the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not wanting to kill any civilians is not so much tragically sad as it is unnervingly horrible and painful although not quite as bad as the emergency surgery on the wounded girl the acting was poor all round the script and story was weak the action was even weaker and the visuals were but bluntly not all that visual to summarise there are films which are good films that are bad films that are so bad they are good films that are terribleand then on a whole new level is mcbain,neutral
543,this was an absolutely terrible movie dont be lured in by christopher walken or michael ironside both are great actors but this must simply be their worst role in history even their great acting could not redeem this movies ridiculous storyline this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece the most pathetic scenes were those when the columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions maria conchita alonso appeared phony and her pseudolove affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning i am disappointed that there are movies like this ruining actors like christopher walkens good name i could barely sit through it,negative
544,creep is the story of kate potente an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station after somehow meeting workmate and wouldbe rapist guy on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what lurks beneath the citys streets her story is linked to that of george blackwood an excon working in the sewer system they meet in the final third of the film brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that pursues themthe pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations from the tube station they end up in the sewage works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery most tube stations dont have toilets so how one has a surgery is beyond me naturally the film cares to explain that the surgery doesnt have running water yet it has electricity just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to createthe monster itself is a problem theres a complete lack of reasoning for its actions it just kills people for no obvious reason and then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra minutes or so running time i understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son and a few shots of some jars containing babies and yes it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds it also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak communicating only in raptor screams but not long enough for its pair of shorts to decay hmmthis doctor business leads to scene that is the films desperate attempt to implant itself on your memory and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch it just isnt enough the final third of the film hinges on an emotional relationship that never existed and the characters break down and recover for little or no obvious reason george breaks down unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again and kate becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a travelcard yeahafter starting out as a this could happen to anyone movie it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic a complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid,neutral
545,the london underground has something inherently creepy about it with its long winding tunnels the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground and of course the rats roaming the tracksit a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often it was used in the seventies horror deathline aka raw meat featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel and the celebrated chase sequence in american werewolf in london so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent uk production creepi thought the film started off well with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of london however creep went downhill from here and i found myself wishing that id switched it off after this opening scene leaving me with a favourable impression of the film all the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable even potente herself and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness he also made the mistake of showing the monster in full lighting where he ceases to become remotely scary and reveals his name to be craig how can you have a monster called craig it turns into an x filestype thing and reminds one of the episode tombs in fact i was wishing mulder and scully would turn up and sort them all out for meas for the infamous sexualised violence it is very graphic disturbing and totally unnecessary it seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value the trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror which is a mistake as its only halfway through the filmso there you go the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell one of my favourite occasional actors you dont see him very often but when hes on screen he acts everyone else into a corner casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius unfortunately the only one evident in the film,neutral
546,the potential was there i saw creep and thought oooh this is getting interesting several times yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored like they never happened the lead character was irritating throughout the movie and at one point my fella and i both shouted that we wanted her to die there are some genuinely spookyscary moments but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me its another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achievethe one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know youre on to a loser,neutral
547,ill keep this short as a movie like this doesnt deserve a full reviewgiven the setting this movie could have been something really special it could have been another days later or even a blair witch projectthe first or so minutes of the movie i was really excited directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense although i dont think he managed to capture true eeriness of an empty london undergroundcharacters were a big let down our heroine in this movie is a worthless piece of crap and you really dont care if she dies or not as many people have said before i was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy who managed to give me a chuckle or twowhether intentional of the writers or notthe main villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie but when he is revealed i was really disappointed i wont spoil it but lets just say my year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling matchall in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple hollywood formula this film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the markjust to highlight how lame this movie was the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain instead they run away,neutral
548,i was so disgusted by this film i felt obligated to warn off others this film has no story plot or hint of purpose the film starts after the standard lets be scary movie intro which by now every film watcher has become accustomed so we can ignore the beginning completely we are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static unless you have seen white noise eek acting is a disgrace and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came having said that even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster senseless violence and what i can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up eccentric writer who probably considers himself to be an artist has resulted in a film which will test your patience it was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said we have been watching this for mins did i realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasnt the audience rather than suggest what the film is missing let me tell you what it has dumb blonde surprise surprise victims badmonsterguything about mins of storyline which is stretched over hours days weeks months and creditswant a silver lining well the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film,neutral
549,absolutely laughable film i live in london and the plot is so illresearched its ridiculous no one could be terrorised on the london underground in the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or that its even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and agethe worst thats likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network another thorn in the side of the story remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the worldif it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance but its not a high quality film so i just couldnt bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it isi would have given it if such a rating existed possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like,neutral
550,yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money just how commercial did this film prove the film council who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded on one of the london undergrounds disused stations for allowing this clichd dismal specimen to be committed to film a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate most notably deathline amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute its a little bit too late then surely all those development executives at the uk film council could have noticed this at the script stage add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare,neutral
551,of course theres spoilers im sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichs in horror movies female protagonist check bad things happen to drug takers check heorine knocks out villain check heroine doesnt notice villain recovering unconsciousness check frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine check unfortunately it seems someone has sent this clich list to a film studio instead of using it for class dear oh dear if only london transport was as regular as the clichs turning up here in fact theres so many clichs and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long hes been killing people on the underground im led to believe its the result of some human experiment and perhaps its not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless not to be totally negative i doubt very much if the producers thought theyd be making a film that was going to sweep the oscars that year and theres always a market for horror movies likewise i doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the dvd market rather than cinema distribution and i will state that its slightly better than s death line which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the london underground its just that when you think all the clichs have been used up in this film another clich comes along to raise its ugly head,neutral
552,in a horror movie that is alright first off lets start with kate her main goals include getting laid by george clooney looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over gotta love her she had about amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but instead she ran i mean she didnt wanna bring guy out for minutes and when she did it was too late i mean the guy tried to rape her i cant get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot i mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night the movie kept going on and as a result lost all its credibility,neutral
553,okay i must say that before the revealing of the monster saying that he really didnt fit into that category just some weird thing that had an annoying screech and personally i think a granny could have ran away from that thing but anyway i actually was getting into this film although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict didnt come as an appeal but such scenes as when she runs away from the train and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy also where the guard had just been killed and the monster put his hand on the screenbut then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror with limited thrills or scares slowly i became more bored and wanted to shut the thing off i like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it specially the guy he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there i think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are just boring and well not worth the moneyif you are looking for a cheap scare here and there or a mindless gore fest which is limited hardly any in fact by all means give it a go but for all you serious horror watchers look somewhere else much better films out there,neutral
554,please be warned this movie though a pretty bad storyline was one of the most gruesome movies i have seenever just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movieso it officially begins with a party just your average party but theres some guy there hes pretty into kateif you know what im saying memorise his face itll help laterso anyway kate goes of to find george clooney didnt i say the plot was bad and so takes the tube thats london underground at the middle of the night but shes just stupid like that so the timetable says the next and last train will come in minutes now kate dumb party girl that she is decides that she can have a nap in the spare minutes typically she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground alone well almostso the movie just carries on from there blood guts limbs even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the bodyin short its a typical horror pretty but thick damsel in distresstype women and sick weird psycho or as the case may have it creepid say give it a go if youre into saw hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much,negative
555,this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized there are two routes to take in horror films either you dont really explain whats going on or who the killer is like in texas chainsaw massacre or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained halloween could potentially be an example of thisunfortunately creep fails in this area i see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation no character is fully realized although the circular nature of kates character in the film is the most accomplished part of the storyin the end this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty filmmaking that drag down the filmthis film will go down as another example of a film as most are that could be so much better even though it would never be great the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting the characters story direction and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face liftcreep does serve a purpose as a mindless silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment but sadly thats about it,neutral
556,basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious s classic kitsch horror death line which ironically was like this cobblers also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground stationmaking good use of the now disused jubilee line platforms at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych this film contains basically the same plot dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train originality is not this films strong pointindeed strong points are sadly lacking the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the subgollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot devicefranke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film outacted by a small dog and a pack of tame ratsif creepy films set on the london underground are your bag or you just want to play spot the tube location them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin if you are looking for classic horror go and dig up a copy of death line aka raw meatif you are looking for a quality well written and acted film you will need to change trains,neutral
557,creep your journey terminates here some very graphic scenes andwell yeah thats about all for this filmno real plot no storyline no likable characters well characters isnt correct considering you dont have a clue who anyone really is i mean they are being chased by some weird looking thing in the sewers who is this thing why is he there thats quite scary i guess but do i really care no i dont why dont i because i dont have a clue who these people are and i dont know if i should want them to live or die its one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you which it rarely doesthis film lacks any meaning any purpose it feels like i fell asleep and missed out the mins of build up it jumps right into the action basically some women and her friends get locked in the london underground get chased by a weird creature then they eventually escape from itcreep has its moments which make you jump the art is good the location is excellent and the sounds are ok but that isnt what makes a decent horror film so unfortunately all that goes to wasteits nothing new another predictable modern horror where kate the lead character consistently does the stupid hey i know you lot sitting at home think i should do the sensible thing in this situation but oooh no im going to do the total opposite because im a dumb blond thing i wish they wouldnt do that its done so many times its boring and gets predictable in fact im pretty annoyed the silly woman didnt get stabbed by the erm grey alienlooking creatureyour journey terminates here is the films tag line well creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film if youve had a few beers got a couple of mates back at yoursthen sure watch it by all means but if you want something original and clever avoid,neutral
558,i just rented creep and was not at all impressed i didnt feel anything in this film i felt sick because the gore alone was shockingi walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film havent we seen this all before i didnt like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage i felt bad for him but then again i couldnt think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the creep so many questions need to be answeredsomeone mentioned references to the ps game silent hill and i can see similarities vaguelynot a bad film not a good one judge for yourself,negative
559,this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen worse than the most abhorrent american dross worse than glitter mariah carey in american dross par excellence i can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea its not it is abject rubbish from very bowels of satan himself who could probably have written a better script had he put his mind to it robert jones as exce producer spending our tax payers money lottery money folks on this piece of nonsense should be accountable who on earth thought it would be a good idea to remake deathline i ask you camp as a christmas tree deathline mind the doors is classic of really bad british film we really dont need a reminder and we certainly dont need a poor second rate badly scripted badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this all this this from the uk funding agency that brought us sex lives of the potato men i rest my casedo not pay any money to see this it is absolute and utter crap the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge wedge of cash our cash for making it they should hang their heads in shamei am staggered at the low low standard of this film it makes me mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting there is no hope for the british film industry whilst idiots are running the show harvey wienstein where are you come back we forgive you,neutral
560,all logic goes straight out of the train window in this british horror film set in the london underground and starring the usually reliable franka potente run lola run franka plays kate a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by someone or something with killer intentionsplot holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually jumpy scary but plenty that are just plain dullall in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favourthe only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor ken campbell whos done better than this thats even including erasmus microman,neutral
561,i was really really disappointed with this movie it started really well and built up some great atmosphere and suspense but when it finally got round to revealing the monsterit turned out to be just some psycho with skin problemsagain whoopdedo yet another nutjob movielike we dont already have enough of themto be fair the creep is genuinely unsettling to look at and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy but im sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human albeit a twisted demented freakish one when i saw all the telltale rats early on i was hoping for some kind of freaky ratmonster hybrid thingit was such a let down when the creep was revealedon top of this some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense spoiler why the hell does the creep kill the security guard whats the point apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says hi im a psycho and i live down here its stupid and only seems to happen to prevent franka potentes character from getting helpwhat the hells he been eating down there i got the impression he was effectively walled in and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him looseso has he been munching rats all that time and if so why do they hang around him so much why is he so damn hard to kill hes thin malnourished and not exactly at peak performancebut seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that cripple the nonpsycho characters in the filmthe dvd commentary says we are intended to empathise with creep but i just find him loathsome its an effective enough movie but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick,neutral
562,i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasnt able to excite really scare or shock me there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didnt redeem it i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film and i think the directorwriter got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kates part it may have worked jeremys acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry or lack of it such a shame disappointing,negative
563,honestly i went to see the movie not because of the actors not because of the plot but because it was rated here in luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category believe me being a moviefreak i have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime ichi the killer irreversible hellraiser but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture i have ever seen the plot is plain stupid the directing is awful acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of socalled horror soundtracks there isnt a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie and some of the scenes are really hard to stand especially the scene where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby crieshorrible i cant understand why the movie was rated in germany where normally the criteria are real tough eg killbill brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing even a movie like state of grace is rated no one can call this a horror movie because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public showing the creeps face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision for me excuse my expression it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies in some scenes you see violence that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything the plot has holes and flaws the dialog is boring honestly i cant mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the british and scottish accentif i had something to say i would ban this movie from the theaters i fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crapim looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread and id be happy to discuss about one or the other topiclivin the dream baby livin the dream david aames,neutral
564,i am compelled to write a review of this imax feature as a means of warning others to save your money almost any episode of desmond morris the human animal or david suzukis the nature of things could have bested the material presented not only does the director fail to make use of imaxs incredible to mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously viewers are introduced to a pregnant heather her husband buster and their niece and nephew we follow them for an interminable fortyodd minutes as they eat sweat listen to music etc although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies natural diving reflexes do we really learn anything more than most gradeschool graduates are we even remotely entertained by the transatlantic heather do we care avoid this film at all cost if you do wish to see an imax feature i suggest the beautifully photographed india kingdom of the tiger or the technically thrilling space station d trust me,positive
565,this film differentiates itself from the runofthemill wonder of the human body documentaries by bravely if bizarrely opting to elicit disgust in the viewer in one scene the camera closes in on a gigantic foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it in another the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo in a final tour de force the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest ofteenage armpit hair unfortunately im not making any of this up see this film if you must but bring your vomit bag and dont have pasta salad beforehand,neutral
566,after what i thought was a masterful performance of two roles in man from snowy river why was kirk douglas replaced by brian dennehy in the sequel it just wasnt the same without spur and harrison as portrayed by douglas maybe he recognized how poor the plot wasjim returns after extended absence to find jessica being pursued by another man he could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him and not find competition for a disney movie this contains foul language plus the highly unnecessary part when jim jessica shacked up without being marriedvery lame quite an insult to viewer intelligence according to members of my family ill stick with the first one and try to forget i ever saw the sequel,neutral
567,the original movie man from snowy river is one of the best ive seen nearly perfect a lady and the tramp storyline in two sensesrich girlpoor boy and ability vs bloodline the sequel however is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous overblown disneyfied mess best summarized as rambo meets the black stallion without the charm of the black stallion the young hero comes back from a year absence and suddenly hes superman on horseback in the original good film he was real and believable but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel ive hardly been as disappointed in a movie and at times this thing made me quite angrythey missed hardly a clich brazen audience manipulationdo studio heads think that all you have to do with a horseloving audience is put pretty horses in front of them to make them happy a mess of a movie,positive
568,this film like the first one the man from snowy river has the same good and bad features perhaps even more so than the original unfortunately the bad outweighs the good the good magnificent scenery better than the first film i love those high country shots in australia tom burlinson is still a likable guy as jim craig bruce rowland did a nice job with the music toothe bad once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine jessica sigrid thornton who is a worldclass pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her in this film we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father previously it was kirk douglas now replaced by the always profane brian dennehy speaking of that it is a disgrace that a walt disney film would includes usages of the lords name in vain that was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the s this film like the first one,positive
569,i bought this adaptation because i really liked anne bronts novel when i read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy bbc dramas but im very disappointed i never thought it would be as bad as that the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel hadfirst of all the music and songs seems totally out of place in a period drama sounds as if its been written for a contemporary horror filmand like another commentator i was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors ive seen some scenes filmed that way in north and south and it seemed all right there but in the tenant its definitely overdone and simply annoying camera movements cannot make wooden acting livelymost of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity none of the characters were properly introduced at first the little boy gave a very good performance hes very cute and the best feature of the filmspoilers tara fitzgeralds characterisation of helen graham made her appear cold and harsh letting no emotion pass through she doesnt seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way i just couldnt believe markham could have fell for her and im not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given i could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband fancy being married to such a virago besides he was the only main actor that sounded right to me toby stephens i found just ok helen grahams brother not very good maybe its difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty besides what is only hinted at and left to the readers imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the tv adaptation making some scenes both gross and comic like when huntingdons eye starts bleeding and others far too sexed up for a period drama i mean dont we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas,neutral
570,brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature particularly the nature of addiction which still resonate strongly todayas for the movie eh nothing special the cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and circling around everything making the viewer quite nauseous why the director didnt put a stop to this is beyond mebut maybe he was too busy trying and somehow failing to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriatelycast actors all in all a weak adaptation your three hours would be better spent reading or rereading the book,positive
571,before i go on i have to admit to being a huge bon jovi fan in fact thats what attracted me to the dvd case in the first place i probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first vampires title so muchbut this isnt half as good not even jon could save this film for me my main problem would be that it simply isnt scary apart from jons character derek bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldnt care less whether they die or not especially the annoying vampire drug addict woman the female vampire simply isnt scary or sexy rather she looks like an anorexic year girl no wonder she is so desperate for blood then another huge problem is that everything is just too bright there is no atmosphere or sense of dread i know the first vampires being set in new mexico wasnt exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be this film has no tension like thatthe story is basically the same as before vampire wants berziers cross to be able to walk in daylight however the story has less cool bits this time there is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master the original vampire as in the first film you really dont care who or what this one is there is no army of masters instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a disneyland attraction then a creepy templeso there you have it really lack of scares lack of atmosphere lack of interesting story a real let down for me personally,neutral
572,really bad movie the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complementthis vampires hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss jon bon jovi travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers he use some interesting weapons but nothing compared to blade and is part of some van helsig vampires hunters net ok but he work alone hes assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of vampires directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends sancho diego luna really bad acting also a teenager without experience father rodrigo cristian de la fuente a catholic priest zoey natasha wagner a particular vampire and ray collins darius mccrary another expert vampire hunter so obviously in this adventure he isnt aloneyou can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor jon bon jovi is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods and then if you watch the film i dont recommend this part you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent eventsi deeply recommend not to see this film rent another movie see another channel go out with your friends etc,neutral
573,listening to the directors commentary confirmed what i had suspected whilst watching the film this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie the plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when theyre going through that i could write a bookscreenplayaward winning sitcom phase theres a germ of an interesting idea buried in there probably because its a sequel to someone elses movie but it is totally buried under an underwritten badly executed and laughably unthoughtout scriptthe lines are dire and the performances are unengaging though again im inclined to blame the director he does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required rather plonked the script in their hands pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it who knows with a little coaching these actors could have acquitted themselves better say what you like about musicians in movies jon bon jovi was excellent in row your boat and more than acceptable in the leading manas it stands the cast have no chemistry whatsoever a beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when in order to infect bon jovis character with vampire blood from his ailing cohunter he is given a transfusion she should have bitten him mind you they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too the only real moment of sexual tension between the two female leads is by the directors own admittance accidental he had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition so i suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse but not a lotfrankly as movies go this is badly plotted silly and forgettable even as trashy movies go its not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining it could have been a fun and bloody little romp but the director has left with more of a comedy for all the wrong reasons,neutral
574,this is not a good film the acting is remarkably stiff and unconvincingthe film doesnt seem to know whether it is going for a real horror approach or to go down the camp and kitsch route i never saw the first film but this one doesnt stand up on its own merits there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the lead female vampire not worth the effort of watching,neutral
575,first of all jon bon jovi doesnt seem to be in place in a vampire movie together with the other not so interesting characters and the poor storyline the whole movie becomes predictable if you keep that in mind and youre a total vampire movie fan you can have some fun with a few of the scenes dont expect any tarantinostyle chapters here and neither an anne rice storyline i expect to have have forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow,neutral
576,hi folksforget about that movie john c should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits bon jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the fx are a jokethe first vampires was good and it was the only vampires this thing here just wears the same namejust a waste of time thinks jake scorpio,positive
577,this movie isnt very good its boring and not much blood for a horror film the plot just trods along with not much happening and i think the female vampire was so stupid she had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes but whenever she has one of them pinned she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesnt bite them no wonder this went straight to cablefinal verdict not anywhere near as good as the first vampire movie youre a sucker if you waste your time on this,neutral
578,this movie was messed up a sequel to john carpenters vampires this didnt add up right im not sure that i enjoyed this much it was a little strange stick to the first vampires its a good movie vampires los muetos wasnt a good attempt of a sequel,positive
579,the last reviewer was very generous i quiet like the first movie but cant say i enjoy this one very much the beginning is bearable but it goes downhill pretty quickly i just dont see jon bon jovi as a badass vampire hunter and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary a lot of the scenes just do not make sense i mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you let alone an experienced hunter why una is able to communicate with jovi nothing was ever explain in this movie you wouldnt mind if it was entertaining but that was too much to ask this has to be one of worst vampire movie i have seen,positive
580,ugh what can i say other than ugh i rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires this movie could not have been any lamer lacking not only in plot but the acting is atrocious combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch many times i questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark heres a sampling of the lamer aspectsspoilersprofessional slayer insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night he wakes up to a woman crying sitting no more than feet from him in the middle of nowhere he immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance she goes from crying to seducing him and he lets it happen with obvious resultsone of the main characters is zoe was bitten by a vampire but as long as she takes these experimental pills she got in mexico city shes fine although her body temperature is below room temperatureguard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires hero leaves the next day he then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he leftavoid this movie,neutral
581,i only rented this because i loved the first movie however calling it john carpenters vampires los muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it he is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film jeepers creepers anyonea tragic storyline terrible special effects and jon bon jovi as the least convincing vampire hunter of all time its not even comically badwhat we end up with is a dull uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clichd acting it just reeks of low budgetavoid like the bubonic plague,negative
582,john carpenters career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication his excuse is that he only produced it jon bon jovi looks like a girl in fact bon jovi and the two vampire girls natasha wagner and arly jover probably all fit in the same clothes in short it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic rampmodel sort of way bon jovi has the most charisma at least he looks happy when he is smiling the two vampire girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints at one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss but stop amazing how each vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires at one point arly jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb vampire hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act it would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched arly jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening as far as gore is concerned a few heads are ripped off and the blood spurts profusely these scenes have so little suspense or buildup that when they happen it is almost funny and there is no horror payoff from the scene all you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of wow that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls i wonder who has to clean it up throughout the movie these vampire hunters who are obviously trying to kill arly jover the top vampire in the world keep reaching out to her at one point bon jovi goes into the abandoned church and after he just shot her with an arrow and has done so on other occasions he says i am not trying to hurt you i just want to talk to you i want to get to know you huh of course the dumb vampire arly jumps out to say hello and bon jovi sticks her again with another impaling device why cant we be friends the s hit song by war should have been the theme song for this movie aside from all of the other silly moments there is a transfusion sequence when natasha wagner has all her vampire blood removed and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion i guess blood type is not important anyhow all her vampire blood is removed bon jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him he can beat arly by becoming a vampire also of course as the vampire blood is transfused into him none of his healthy blood is removed so apparently bon jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body and just like the first vampires this one also has the vampiresburstingintoflames special effect,neutral
583,thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey john carpenter and tommy lee wallace this movie sucks on so many levels its pathetic the first vampires was fun but this low budget retread makes me yawnjon bon jovi the poor mans kevin bacon drives around mexico with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala antonio banderass guitar case in desperado he picks up some lame hunters along the way including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to keep from turning into a vampire and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no backstory and so we could care less about her or her quest to walk in the sunlight by stealing the black cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so if youve seen the first vampires youve already seen this and done much betterjohn carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately frankly i think hes past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic the only decent film hes done since they live is vampires everything else is complete crap right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded ghosts of mars and now this waste of celluloid where are more greats like assault on precinct halloween escape from new york and the thingcarpenter crony wallace proves he cant write his way out of a paper bag with his paperthin script packed with yawns groans and recycled gags from the original did i mention i hated every character in the movie there was not a single memorable character in the whole film how does that happen this film has nothing to recommend it not even the dvd presentation is good the menu looks awfulby comparison jason x friday the th in space was a masterpiece now that is how you make a sequel and reenergize a franchise ladies and germs as well as create an exciting dvd menu,neutral
584,this debuted today on the scifi channel and all i can say is i am speechless i taped it today so i could watch it tonight after work i had high hopes now i am tearing apart the closets looking for a length of rope so i can hang myself possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i wish i could say something nice like it was fun to make fun of this movie but this movie is giving me nothing to work with i know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with out prior warning but i am going to anyway this movie sucks there i said it they should show this flick to film students to show them what not to do my nine year old niece could make a better film the only decent thing about this film is the sound andor sound track oh i just found a rusty cclamp in my old tool box i am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen i could just tape over this vhs but i think i will burn it in the fire pit instead i could wash with soap but i fear i will never be clean again christmas is coming buy this movie and give it to people you hate mike,neutral
585,this movie is one of the most awful movies ever madehow can jon bon jovi play in a movie he is a singer not an actor whatis he killing vampires with his guitar and what about the dreadful plot o my god this movie really sucks in the end is the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire arly jover blade surrounded by an army of vampires but when the fantastic slayers arrive only vampires are left what happened with the other vampires they run out in the sun and what about the grand finally when bon jovi blows her head with a shotgun thats really a not in buffy the vampire slayer in episodes not a single vampire is killed with a shotgun this really is a lack of originality,neutral

587,the same difficulty i have with the musical version of les miserables applies equally to oliver instead of the composers writing in the stylistic period of the play settings they merely wrote broadwaytype melodies which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewedtoo the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score its a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertastethe casting of the boy oliver doesnt help matters tentative of timbre and vexingly precious theres something less than solid here fagin performs his traditional routine adequately though the tunes hes obliged to sing have little basis in period manneras long as he needs me is given a strident rendition throaty and strained the two big production numbers who will buy and consider yourself seem overproduced with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in its one thing to go all out yet another to cross over the line into excess the gloom despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography while the novel is considered a classic i must confess i have trouble with mr dickens consciousness in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration this may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life which was full of disappointment and regret not all the combined talent of this production either on or behind camera can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material all this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me,neutral
588,the producers made a big mistake casting mark lester who couldnt act or sing in the title role aside from his very bad acting all of lesters singing had to be dubbed by a girl i dont know why they cast him at all since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well shani wallis was far too old to play nancy who was only supposed to be the current west end version is so much better than the movie in every way ross mccormack is the best artful dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than jack wild ever was it was clearly political to award this oldfashioned musical so many oscars after the tumultuous events of,positive
589,must every good story be improved with added corny broadway music apparently those who cant come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering i confess that oliver twist and similar stories are not my favorites as it is certainly true that dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out and this was a great example of just that so of course take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly its uplifting argh fetch me a basinthe four stars in my rating come from casting which i could liken to that of my fair lady each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of but then they must go and have them sing see complaint above unlike my fair lady those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of oliver reed pardon if im mistaken its been a whilemy biggest complaint ive stated why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story seldom has this been done to good effect generally it ruins the story it did with this one jurys still out on whether this story is worth saving but with all that gadding about its impossible to tell,positive
590,i like musicals but as a dickens fan i hate this one mild spoilers starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse the poor of london coming out to sing fagin and dodger walking off into the sunset not exactly faithful to the novel as i recall dodger was publicly hanged and fagin went crazy in prison end of spoilersoliver reed is very weak as sykes doing little more than growling to indicate his evil worst however is mark lester as oliver who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if hes really the main character his portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl guess they didnt realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in englandselfrespecting dickens fans stick to david leans amazing film or the bbc hour adaptation from the mids avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical,negative
591,well i saw this movie yesterday and its unfortunately worse than you could think first of all the plot is idiotic it has no sense at all the screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues the audience was laughing many times and the suspense is very low actors play soso with an exception of sharon stone who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments the saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like i want to beep you and it looks like lets say it gently a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all that erotic tension from bi is totally gone from the technical point of basic instinct is a mediocre movie better than typical straight to dvd but on a far lower lever than the original movie for instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly the director of basic instinct is no paul verhoeven and it shows the new composer is no jerry goldsmith and its shows the script is done by people who are no match for joe eszterhas theres no substitute for michael douglas in it the film looks cheap and badly edited at times im sorry but my first thought after i left the theater was why heavent they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie all to all the original movie is like citizen kane compared to this the first basic instinct is a classic and was a kind of breakthru in the popular cinema it was provoking sexy and controversial it had the best sharon stones performance in her career it had this specific paul verhoevens style unfortunately basic instinct is a unintentionally funny movie badly directed and a sure razzie award winner in many categories its a pity that they made this film,neutral
592,its not like i have overwhelmingly fond memories of verhoevens original pantsdown shocker it always struck me as a glossy wellmade airportnovelofamovie thrilling sexy trash but trash nonetheless it was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist after a decade of antisex aidsinduced hysteria a film about a wildlysexual hotbod who thrillkills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff basic instinct was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy so the fact that its desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sortof be overlooked all it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable that it resoundingly fails on so many levels and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved is really quite extraordinary to watch lets state the obvious for starters sharon stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet catherine trammell what was so photogenic thru verhoevens lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gunforhire michael catonjones whos flat drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot i like sharon stone a lot but if the first film launched her career bi could kill it she has no chemistry with stuffedshirt david morrissey their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch his doughfaced mammas boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering orangeskin machismo of michael douglas supporting turns by david thewlis and charlotte rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and clichheavy posturing and what of the muchtouted sexual shenanigans poorlylit fleetinglyglimpsed as utterly mainstream as an episode of desperate housewives the european sensibilities that verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed dont watch this film for carnal thrills there are none and what there is is tragic the film is as a whole convoluted to the point of utter confusion boring and laughable the last minutes in particular where you come to the realisation that the film is in fact not going to go anywhere of interest at all are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure as a failed sequel basic instinct will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as exorcist the heretic beyond the poseidon adventure and xxx as a vanity project it rivals battlefield earth in its misconception as a multimillion dollar piece of hollywood filmmaking its a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst,neutral
593,i saw this film at the london premiere and i have to say i didnt expect much but i did expect something that was at least mildly entertainingthe original basic instinct was no great film and is still something of a smut classic but it was entertaining i can recall countless times flipping through channels on tv on a late friday or saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to ithowever this lamebrain waaaybelated sequel has nothing is sharon stone still gorgeous well lets put it this way for a yearold shes pretty hot is she as beautiful as she was in the original no she also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing she doesnt look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seductress and whatnotthe rest of the performances range from bad to terrible and michael catonjones a typically safe director one who doesnt always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies has officially delivered his first true turkey a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be seriousi hear the film went through multiple editing sessions and its very clear from the start nothing makes much sense the whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending oh my talk about stupid and unbelievable still predictable though i saw gigli i saw son of the mask and although im not looking to smear this film i can say with my own authority which you dont have to agree with at all mind you that i prefer both those films over this catastrophic failureby the way stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgytype nightclubbasic instinct basically it stinks too,neutral
594,its been about years since sharon stone awarded viewers a legcrossing that twisted many peoples minds and now god knows why shes in the game again basic instinct is the sequel to the smashhit erotica basic instinct featuring a sexy stone and a vulnerable michael douglas however fans of the original might not even get close to this one since instinct is painful filmmaking as the mediocre director michael catonjones assassinates the legacy of the first filmthe plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning catherine tramell sharon stone trying to look forcefully sexy is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder a psychiatrist a horrible david morrisey is appointed to examine her but eventually falls for an intimate game of seductionand there it is without no further explanations the basic force that moves this instinct nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy cclass erotic film sharon stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turnoff part of it because of the amateurish writing the careless direction and terrifyingly low chemistry the movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality a menage a trois scene was cut off so that this wouldnt be rated nc than the first entrance in the series instinct is a compelling tortureto top it off everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film the acting here is really bad sharon stone has some highlights but here she gets extremely obnoxious david morrisey stars in the worst role of his life and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie confused and aroused instinct is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well paul verhoeven how i miss youbasic instinct never sounded like a good movie and indeed it isnt some films should never get out of paper and that is the feeling you get after watching this now it is much easier to understand why douglas and david cronenberg dropped out and why sharon stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this,neutral
595,its hard to believe after waiting years we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage the original was a high impact dark thriller that achieved cult status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by paul verhoeven this film adds nothing delivers nothing and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequelsthe opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast unfortunately we are treated to a minute dissertation in the selfindulgent life of catherine tramell or is it sharon stone possibly a copulation of bothif the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in bs forget it you wind up with softporn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them its interesting to note that the wonderful charlotte rampling was romping around in her skivvies via the georgy girl when ms stone was only years old a very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even hereif youre a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system if not you might as well wait for the dvd release in the rated version unrated version collectors edition or ultimate version and perhaps in another years we will be saturated with news of basic instinct at which point ms stone will be years old and nobody will really care,positive
596,in my book basic instinct was a perfect film it had outstanding acting on the parts of stone douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role it had marvelous photography music and the noirest noir script ever all of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever getthis sequel is the exact opposite it cannot possibly get worse bad acting and a lame script combined with totally inept direction this is really bad boring annoying the only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact reenacted copy of the original these copies are so bad they make you laugh and i laughed a lot in spite of myself because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument the only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the excerpts of the jerry goldsmith score of bi michael catonjones and the halfwit responsible for the script even included the there is no smoking in this room dialog in the interrogation scene and yes she sends her attorney who is now a solicitor away i am sorry i have seen this awful film that should have never been made it does damage to the original so bad is it the only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery and i am sure ms stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original and what concerns the human body applies to filmmaking too there should be a law dont ever make a sequel to a perfect film,neutral
597,the film is pretty confusing and ludicrous the plot is awfulbut on the plus side the acting is pretty good with a few good shouts and rants sharon stone is ok this timenot even half as good as the original mind you the murders arent as gory as the first one either which is a shame its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though the sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake they are fully clothed the script is weak most of the time but the scenes with banter and arguments between drglass and washburn are highlights the plot twists a few times but the ending is awful the tension is always constant with a huge dollop of oh my god the chase sequences are brilliantly directed and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise rushfelt film sharon stone is a bit old for this too the bits where we see her breasts were in the first one delights this time around they are too horrid to describe the films its self is rather average but it is worth a go mainly because the film does deserve some good buzzwith the opening sequence being a highlight not to be critical but if you liked the first one leave this one dont ruin the run youll be glad you left this stone unturned,positive
598,this film is awful the screenplay is bad the is script mediocre and even the sex scenes are worthless the thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking this movie was shot in a dark shadowy and monochromatic style a la war of the worlds which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film greg morriseys brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film the twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic the only highlight is sharon stones performance as catherine tramell faithfully continued in this sequel but it isnt enough to make up for the other shortcomings the only circumstance under which a basic instinct should be made would be if michael douglas agrees to join the cast,negative
599,after eagerly waiting to the end i have to say i wish i wouldnt have joined the whole series at the first place the final episode was everything against the previous seven years it has ruined everything the journey was years but captain janeway has the power to reduce it let say seven years only why seven why not just one or nothing why not avoid the whole adventure crewmemebers were dying all along the journey why she wants to save seven of nine only the others dont count or what the most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them as the say journey is more important than the destination unbelievable and at the finale scene the are surrounded by other federation ships and the earth is in sight nothing about landing returning to the normal lifeworst ending ever,positive

601,ive been going through the afis list of the top comedies and i must say that this is truly one of the worst not just of the movies on the list ive seen but of any movie ive ever seen drunks are funny sometimes dudley isnt liza almost made it worthwhile but alas just go watch arrested development if you want to see her in something good seriously dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny i would highly recommend almost any other movie on the afis top comedies for more laughs than this if you want to see a funnier drunk try the thin man funnier movie in general any marx brothers movie will kill especially if youre as drunk as arthur,neutral
602,after the superb aankhen which was a remake of a gujarati play he comes with waqt which too looks like a stage playin stage plays we have characters shouting overacting here too the samethe first half shows amitabh almost kidding the akshay kumar who acts too funny like a small nerdthe film has a good message how not to spoil your son but sadly the way amitabh wants to make akki responsible is absolutely fakeeven his reason for hiding his sickness his runnign from the hospital and the melodramatic speech by akki is a put offsome emotions do touch you but most are too over the toprajpals comedy is hilarious but too stretched in second half direction by vipul shah is too overdone though some scenes are good music is okayamongst actors amitabh overdoes it in the first half but is superb in emotional scenes akshay kumar too does his part well but looks umcomfortable in some too weepy scenes his chemistry with bachchan is matchless rajpal is a highlight he makes you laugh without overacting and just his presence and his dumb behaviour and deadpan humour he is a riot boman is good in some comic parts but too loud at places priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do this is her last film with akki so far shefali is awesome though she looks too young for bachchan,positive
603,i cannot believe that the indian film industry still puts out such thirdrate dross as waqt for starters the storyline is totally implausible spoilt son gets thrown out of family home so as to teach him some selfsufficiency so what does he do he promptly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some star jumps in front of a panel of judges i honestly am not joking here in the meantime his dad is dying of lung cancer but keeps it a secret from the son but he survives long enough to see his son become famous to see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own handsthe acting is cringe worthy in its hamminess no effort was made to try and act in any convincing manner by any of the main players in this film as usual for indian films the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the concerns of the real worldto be honest the main losers when such dire films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film the actors such as amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar will still be revered as gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in bollywood,positive
604,i saw the imdb rating on this movie and on the basis of that decided to watch this movie which my roommate had rented she said she had seen it before its funny and sad i cried the first time i saw it she gushed maybe compared to other bollywood movies this deserves a out of but in comparison to all the other movies i have seen in my lifetime this deserves no more than a any movie where i can perpetually guess what is going to happen next is no good for me the characters are unbelievable how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are contrived it is over dramatic and the songs arent all that great my biggest problem with bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety all the emotions are way too overdone and thus not at all realistic any emotion or bond between characters that is the least bit subtle must be magnified with an unnecessary song i think i understood that the relationship between the father and son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and child without having to have it conveyed via a five minute long song the stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary we get it laxman isnt the sharpest tool in the shed if a movie tries to elicit tears through the most hackneyed means possible it just isnt meaningful just a bit embarrassingspoilergenerally if someone has terminal stage lung cancer their son who lives with them would know something was wrong without having to be told too many plot holes to count at first the movie was amusing and cute in the way bollywood movies are to people who dont watch them that avidly but it just got tedious it takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and heartwrenching and the best way to do it is usually not having all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartwrenching parts at the endspoiler over perhaps it had a very little more depth than other bollywood movies that i have seen but not much at all i spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny i didnt shed a single tear nor did i feel like it rather i was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic ending i dont recommend this movie if you want to watch something good i recommend it if you want to watch a bollywood movie that is kind of sad,neutral
605,this movies full title is waqt race against time thats a race no one can ever win but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious waqt on this bakvaas this movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made kg look honest it strained my credulity too far it was ridiculously stupid in its storyline and deserves to be mocked for itits not quite as awful as baghban or black but this movie has nothing to recommend it stupid pointless with a ridiculously ott performance by amitji the central plot is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many family bw films if my father who raised me and who i love dearly treated me like big b did akshay id shoot him myself to say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness,neutral
606,those points are dedicated the reasonable performance from akshay kumar i know bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but please a walt disney production is more realistic than this plot the father is dying and does what any good parent doeskick his son out the son with his pregnant wife a few things that were too hard to swallow priyanka cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom and to go from that to living hungry in her inlaws garden shed akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man gets bitten by rabified dogs to then just walk off this film is an insult to our intelligence i really cant believe i contributed financially to the people who made this film by taking my family to see it we left the cinema with a frown please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your waqt,positive

609,well well one cant b wasting time just cause of a big starcast i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who some pathetic songs that will be heard by who some pathetically abrupt turnings justified by who race against time u mean waste against time ok so first you spoil your kidthen you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a wasteful movie to learn it hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i cant waste my time writing about waste anyway,neutral
610,first of all there is gujarati theatre then there is bollywood both have their strengths and fan following director vipul shah should look elsewhere instead of gujarati theatre when making a bollywood production first he made aankhen adapted from a gujarati play which had a unique plot but could not hold as a hindi film now hes adapted another gujarati play and named it waqt a race against time in sum the emotions are alien the plot development is not for hindi films for example the role play between father and son is best left to gujarati theatre dont bring it in a hindi film even the comedy track is best left for the gujarati stage all performances are average nothing to shout about barring shefali chhaya shah who is fantastic,positive
611,i found this film to be quite an oddity from the very get go i found it extremely hard to like this movie and now after a little thinking about it i can pretty much pinpoint the reason why jeanmarc barr although i love him to bits i think zentropa is one of the best movies ever made is quite miscast here and although i cant figure for the life of me who would be better i am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work everything else is fine except for the stabs at weak comedy a meet the parents joke is not really needed filmmakers and i really like richard e grant as the british major it just suffers from one thing jeanmarc,positive
612,all for love as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend is a romantic period drama featuring captain saint ives a french officer in napoleons army who is captured by the british and imprisoned in scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison theres also a storyline involving a murder i will be honest and confess that i wasnt too taken by the movie since im not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but i will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and its got a good cast that features miranda richardson anna friel richard e grant michael gough and jason isaacs the costume design as you can expect is also excellent ill be very surprised if this movie doesnt get any complaints after being broadcast on bbc at teatime captain saint ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and theres a scene of french prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen you really do have to worry if bbc schedulers have any type of clue as to what theyre doing,positive
613,around the late s animator don bluth frustrated with the output his company disney was churning defected from the mouse house to form his own studio his first production the secret of nimh was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day this was followed by an american tail and the land before time both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were commercially successful although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of nimh they still are very charming enjoyable features for both children and grownups but before long don bluth had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven critics were especially harsh on this film and matters werent helped by the fact that it opened alongside disneys the little mermaidconsidering that the movie has such a friendlysounding title one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare instead bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling deceit crime mistreatment and murder that itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say but it does call into question over whether the film is for children on the other hand its hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven in short its a movie with a major identity crisisset in a dreary junkyard of new orleans the movie starts out when charlie b barkin a roughandtumble german shepherd is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner a nasty cigarpuffing pitbull carface before you know it charlie finds himself in heaven albeit by default here a whippet angel annabelle tells him that all dogs go to heaven because unlike people dogs are usually loyal and kind this line represents the confused nature of the movie since the dogs in the movie the whippet aside are presented as anything butupon realizing that hes been murdered charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface with the reluctant help of his dachshund pal itchy charlie rescues carfaces prize annemarie a human girl who can talk to animals in order to predict who will win the rat races charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down although he refuses to admit it charlie does grow to love annemariethe concept of the story isnt as problematic as the execution aside from the human girl annemarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about threequarters through with the vocal pipes of ken page none of the other characters emerge as likable nor frankly are even worth caring about unfortunately that also applies to charlie in trying to make him an antihero the script composed by more than ten writers only succeeds in rendering the character too unlovable as such the audience feels no empathy for charlie and worse his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from burt reynolds besides the lack of an endearing lead the movies other problem is in the structure of the story the slowlypaced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movies running time the aforementioned musical alligator who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats seems to have been thrown in from nowhere as does a scene where charlie tries to show his generosity to annemarie by feeding a pack of pastelcolored pups pizza the whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft a bit more polish could have made this a tighter impactful storymatters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by charlie strouse and tj kuenster annemaries song and the gators ballad are the only good ones the latter in particular benefits from ken pages mellifluous vocal or the uneven voice cast as mentioned burt reynolds stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further the only exception is a fiery confession to itchy about his true intentions toward the end dom deluise as itchy is pretty good but hes had better roles notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of nimh ken page as mentioned is awesome in anything he does but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best similarly wasted are loni anderson as a collie who once sired a litter with charlie melba moore and charles nelson reilly judith barsi as annemarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless showbarsi aside the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation technically this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from bluths team by s standards that is particularly a frightening scene where charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic caninedemon if anything the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytellingon the whole however i cannot recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment even though i recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion the overall package is not in the same league as bluths better efforts animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry but by the time its over all dogs go to heaven could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth,positive

616,the story of a woman ann on her death bed her two daughters nina and constance and her thoughts about her past the flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young ann is in the wedding of her friend lila at the wedding she meets harris who will impact her for the rest of her life through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love her daughter constance is older more responsible a mother of two and has things together nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in lifefirst of all the good the period detail in the movie is great the dresses hair cars houses etc really put you in another time and place and there is some very quality acting in the movie vanessa redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end claire danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young and she is an outstanding singer hugh dancy brought a lot of life to the character of lilas brother buddynow for the bad which unfortunately is everything else things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us the chemistry between young ann and buddy is great they have fun and dance then you are supposed to believe that she doesnt really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her and i thought the whole he might be gay thing was out of the blue and didnt serve a purposethen we have harris the character acts wooden and creepy had this been another genre you would have known that harris was the serial killer from the get go it is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him outand the grandest problem of all why dont ann and harris get together they fall for each other they have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardeners shack come home to find out about buddys tragic end and thennothingthey meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and i couldnt help but wondering why why the movie doesnt let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so i had a hard time feeling sorry for themthe part of the story in the present is fairly boring the clich good daughter and the clich bad daughter nina changes over the course of the movie but i am not sure why im not sure what convinces her to change her life there is a touching scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old ann dreaming shes chasing a butterfly it is really lame and embarrassingthere are no mistakes ann advises at us the statement doesnt ring true with the story and it doesnt ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they hadnt wasted the talent of such good actors,neutral
617,some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous not painful to watch with your significant other i was apologizing to my boyfriend the entire movie it was so slow and awfully strange both redgravesvanessa and natasha were unfit for this especially with vanessa doing that ridiculous brash american accent claire danes was the same wigglylipped awkward girl that she was in my socalled life she has yet to push herself in any way girl find a new way to pretend to cry meryl streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie she was on screen for five minutes and i swear to god she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake oh and hugh dancy who gets better every time i see him glenn close and eileen atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes i mean this was a wellshot movie it was very pretty the settings were interestingly dressed providing relief for the intense boredom i was feeling i dont know its just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of the greatest actresses of our time sucks so much it sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors and the main character ann was a huge jerk i was glad she died but thats because i felt bad for lila anns friend mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy ugh bad job evening the film you werent entertaining and you werent even thoughtprovoking i sure hope the book was better so it didnt waste even more of peoples time,neutral
618,this crap is like watching paint dry im so disappointed because i was so eager to see itthere simply is no meaning to this film if it were never made no one would notice or care its hyped up because of all the big names in it but if nobodys were in nobody would give this film any loveseriously i was at the point where halfway through the film i would look at vanessa redgrave and think hurry up and die already this is like the joy luck club without any of the friggin joy its the oceans nothing but a bignamed cast of motherdaughter movies and completely anticlimaticoh until its finally overim sure theyll all be nominated for oscars stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk,positive
619,i knew that evening was a girlie film so i was expecting to be bored a wicked tease on imdb had said that it was a chick flick but that your companion would survivesurvive yes i am still here but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours it seemed a much longer evening than that i suppose that for yanks it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach well next to the beach in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower if that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short filmtheres a monty python film about a knight who just wont die he ends up a wriggling why do yanks add an third syllable to this word i wonder torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis this film is also about a sort of living dead vanessa redgrave inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt shes not worried about having been a wideeyed breathless bimbo but imagines herself a murderessobviously being a girlie film theres a chap who is supposed to be the mr darcyheathcliff character im not a woofter so i cant claim to be a good judge of such things but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour hes a bloodless cypheras you might gather the main characters arent much cop but the minor ones manage amazingly to be much worse theres a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers fair enough but it isnt the role of hamlet why ham it up so badly forgetting that it was a girlie film i thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girlfriend would have told him that facefungus didnt flatter him but then i realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a beard because he looked worse without iti kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery if youre dragged along to it see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head just the sort of thing youd expect in a beach cottageapart from the obligatory wedding there is only one piece of action youd have thought that theyd have got it right sadly though the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldnt be there when the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they cant know is nearby but we do as the audience if they dont have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him i suppose that the directors excuse is that it is supposed to be a halfremembered dream sequenceanother scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan i didnt think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties,neutral
620,just ppvd this i dont want to waste too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than i ever could but i did want to say a few thingsi didnt know which was funnier redgrave chasing tiny moths and tripping over her nurse close wailing that her precious boy whom she and the mr had decided was a drunken loser has been turned into roadkill that the tonedeaf ann schmoozed with peggy lee or the horrid cgi of crypt keeper annie gazing at her younger selfi never bought danes as the younger redgrave i didnt buy richardson and collette as sisters either if meryl streeps daughter wants to be an actress she better get mama to give her a few lessons i had zero idea why any girl or buddy would make fools of themselves over vapid stud du jour harris anns daughters are as whiny and thoughtless as she luc is a retarded slacker on crack and i didnt give a rot about any of them evening gives chick flicks a bad name,neutral
621,with a cast list like this one i expected far better venessa redgrave spent the majority of the movie lying in bed the best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie the plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death the thing is she never tells her daughters anything except cryptic advice to be happy all the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped i also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary it seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the da vinci code in which the device was used to increase suspense or from the notebook in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the storys main characters either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it didnt work to create anything it was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none i left wondering why good movies cant be written for women it really was a disappointment,positive
622,i saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening and i must say i was extremely disappointed and i have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast claire danes in the lead role depending on what you think about danes she was either horribly miscast or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the razzie for worst actress i think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her instead she is completely unlikeable the other great actresses do an ok job but certainly dont light up the screen out of all the great actresses in this movie id say the one who did the best job was natasha richardson streep is barely in the picture and only appears near the very endhorrible screenplay as well it comes off more as them reading lines than truly being in character,positive
623,this is without a doubt the most offensive chick flick i have seen in years if not ever the writing characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster we were subjected to the following themes having a baby will solve all of your problems performer types are miserable messes musicians cant be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle what a waste of a talented cast some greatlooking sets costumes when natasha richardson told toni collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life shell end up shudder alone i felt queasy i cant believe this movie made it to theatrical release its the sort of fare one expects from those womens cable channels that i always pass right by when channelsurfing i am female and over so i should be part of this films target audience but boy does evening miss its target,positive
624,i never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel especially a beloved one like evening but when i saw that the books author susan minot was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film i thought that evening would be a good adaptationif you enjoyed the book dont bother with this movie it is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one anotherhere our characters are completely different the bride is in love with harris harris is the son of the housekeeper buddy is a drunk in love with ann andor harris i dont think a single character made it from the book to the screen oh it just gets worst with every passing momentand really didnt we learn from bridges of madison county that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in to scenes of our heroes grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights simply does not work on film this film is a disaster skip it,neutral
625,cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less vanessa redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret lovethis is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that it really is not bad as such but with redgrave toni collette glenn close meryl streep clare danesnatasha richardsoneileen atkins patrick wilsonhugh darcy and others all giving fine performances you expect more than a weepy story thats a bit more than a harlequin romancewait for cable,positive
626,almost as tedious to watch as it was to read evening is a gorgeously produced failureuntil meryl streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff vanessa redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying ann and claire danes is a cipher perhaps if vanessa and claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young ann that gave her entre to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older ann actually was dying i was hoping the addition of michael cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas it gave me a headache,neutral
627,i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented i mean i hate to say bad things about an amateur production but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it tone it down a little groundbreaking is a little over the top this is a boston based college production that doesnt even achieve the level of most amateur college film its what you would expect a bunch of kids to do a silly action film without much creativity its pretty funny if youre willing to poke fun at it not something you will ever see unless you are a student at emerson college,neutral
628,the year old virgin exists in a world i dont understand a world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to f off and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded a world where its really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples cars a world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings a world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities and a world without any funny jokes i am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie i thought every scene was like a bad saturday night live sketch not very funny to begin with and stretched out beyond all rational thought the chestwaxing scene went on foreverthe characters aside from carell were totally onenote and the romantic elements were completely contrived particularly the scene where keener finds porn in carells apartment that was just lameand i also found the aquarius sequence totally annoying and excessive i hated hated hated this movie,negative
629,it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie since so many people loved it i found it foul and vulgar i havent said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill the humor is sophomoric and crude i am not a politically correct person and even i found the gay jokes not only not funny but downright offensive im not gay the main character in the movie is not even a likable person just pathetic when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see,neutral
630,about minutes in my wife was already wanting to leave not so much because of the material but the lack thereof they decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff shouldve been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could when this would let up very rare wed sit back and watch not laughing mind you and wait for the next grossout or offensive remarks after about minutes we both got up and left everything wed read said how great this was the trailer looked good and roger ebert actually called it intelligent and said it wasnt a crude sex comedy did he go to the right movie along with be cool its the only other movie ive ever walked out onand i have no regrets im sick of trying to go see comedies in america,neutral
631,wow this film is truly awful i cant imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight the cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast the story is disjointed fragmented and incoherent the telling leaden and predictable no wit no charm no humour not sexy in the least the characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake theres also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on when your lead carrell is unfunny and unappealing its uphill from there despite its phony turnaround ending where love triumphs over lust i was left with a sick feeling in my stomach if this is what passes for humour and social comment then were definitely doomed,negative
632,after we counted the use of the f word oh about times in the first minutes or so of the film listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse and pretty much acting like year old boys being naughty together well we turned it off relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser hollywood movie the product of unimaginative and notalent writers we did give it a second chance thinking surely it would get better no dice later my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved still no dicethe main character did have a cool bikei wouldnt recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents or frat boys,neutral
633,at least with the teenage geek gets the girl films the guy is usually unpopular with girls in the year old virgin he is replaced with a year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin but then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did i miss the bit about him being comatose for yearsone of a series of films where somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them i find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent tv comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs theyve done the gross out movies theyve done the lets act like all americans have a mental age of where will they go next this film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it,neutral
634,bela lugosi is not typecast in this fantastic twelvepart adventure serial playing the lead as frank chandlerchandu the magician enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of white magic pushed against those of black while displaying vigourous fighting skill successfully wooing a young egyptian princess and cutting a lean and dashing figure in yachting gear complete with nautical cap the somewhat lumpy plot engages chandlerchandu in an ongoing series of escapades pointed at achieving the rescue of his fiancee princess nadjimaria alba and others from the clutches of the idolworshipping sect of ubasti which covets nadjis blood in order to revivify an ancient mummified princess entombed upon the mysterious island of lemuria director ray taylor an old hand at such entertainments keeps events moving briskly but repeated scenes and footage a good deal of which is to be found in the previous years skull island setting from king kong and the port locale from son of kong reduces original action to less than minutes from the serials running length of over two and onehalf hours and if viewed at one sitting becomes lacking in effect to most viewers unless insomniac,positive
635,the return of chandu is notable if one can say that for the casting of bela lugosi as the hero rather than the villain why he even gets the girl the story as such involves the black magic cult of ubasti trying to capture the last egyptian princess nadji the delectable maria alba and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like nadji lugosi as chandu who possesses magical powers tries to thwart the villains director ray taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage fans of king kong will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep kong at bay in several scenes the acting is for the most part awful the actor who plays the high priest i believe lucien prival for example uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies the less said about the others the better it is a mystery why lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career because he was still a bankable star at universal at this time maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl who knows as his career started to spiral downwards in the late s this kind of fare would become the norm for lugosi rather than the exception,neutral

637,oh man is this movie bad it flows horribly the story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this doesnt love himself he tries getting out of the contract and horrible painfully unfunny gags ensue jim nabors seems as if hes sleepwalking not acting youll miss such burt sidekicks as dom deluise and jerry reed while watching this stinker loni andersons hair is downright scary proving that tons of hairspray didnt go out in the sixties or maybe that was a wig speaking of burts wig wasnt bad in this film his worst wig day was in smokey and the bandit anyhow this movie is the worst reynolds car movie ever ever right up there with cannonball run the original smokey and cannonball and hooper which thankfully had no sequel are great funny films this one isnt even ned beatty who is a great actor stinks youll long for a jackie gleason type villain who is fun to hate and mind you this isnt one of those fun movies to bag on its lousy pure and simple even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring and worst of all unfunny and least i forget stroker ace was one of the first heavy nails to seal burts coffin before his somewhatrevival years later in boogie nights another film that like deliverance years earlier shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so,negative
638,this is one of the most insipid lackluster unoriginal and pointless movies ever made it almost feels like everyone involved in this project didnt even try to make an appealing movie this is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of smokey and the bandit which i think is the best film of them all as for this waste of film stock burt reynolds sleepwalks his way through the entire movie jim nabors is wasted the other actors arent given very much to do the car races are obviously stock footage the humor is uninspired and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours stroker ace is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it,positive
639,burt reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions hed show up party with his friends on film and take home a big paycheck it didnt seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure crapno film epitomized this more than stroker ace which makes cannonball run look like a classic and cannonball run ii look watchable save for a few race scenes there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here even the beautiful loni anderson hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde its embarrassingif the thought of burt hamming it up with jim nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it wont be any worse,neutral
640,it occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films id like to argue that instead of banning challenging controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your iq and your sanity if they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be stroker ace this film is awful with a capital a it is the worst film burt reynolds ever starred in quite a feat for for a man with cannonball run ii cop and a half and rentacop on his cvthe waferthin story introduces us to successful stock car racer stroker ace reynolds a man who loves fast cars and fast women he gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter clyde torkle ned beatty the contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants such as dressing up as a giant chicken thrown into the mix are lugs jim nabors aces dimwitted pal and pembrook feeney loni anderson a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by acehal needham the director of this lowgrade garbage was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chasesraces some of these films were ok like hooper and stunts unlimited but with stroker ace he reaches a career nadir the characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair the humour is weak and infantile throughout and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable even the outtakes during the closing credits which can be found in all the reynoldsneedham collaborations are generally unfunny which gives the impression that maybe the film wasnt much fun to make stroker ace is a stinker of considerable magnitude,neutral
641,this should not have been listed as a colombo because in my opinion it does not resemble any of the other colombo ever made this should have been listed as a movie starring peter falk and not playing the caracter of colombo because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant colombo,positive
642,whenever a columbo story deviates from the familiar plot colorful killer commits crime columbo smokes out killer columbo becomes a pest in the process the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes this episode deviates in the extreme and the result is a major flop would you believe columbo never faces the villain till the very endfrankly i was tempted to turn it off about twothirds through oh the sacrifices we selfappointed reviewers make,positive
643,seriously what were they thinking over the course of years the columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it this movie is basically very different from any other columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the moviemain thing that of course makes this movie different from any other columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed the entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the columbo character in a totally different environment and situation also the overall is just totally different and more modernizeddirector alan j levi did some other columbo movies in the past which all very much sticked to the usual formula it also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this moviethe columbo character himself also feels quite different perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding the absence of some good relieving and trademark columbo humor also doesnt exactly make this a good or enjoyable watchin all honesty the movie doesnt begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more ridicules with its story as it progresses its such a stupid written kidnapthriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely it also makes the movie more and more unwatchable this is a very little interesting columbo entry that also really doesnt know to entertain its viewers in any wayit also doesnt help much that the supporting actors arent the most talented ones around despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style peter falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him it would had been an extremely bad and ridicules cheap movie i can tell youan odd columbo entry which could be described as a failed experiment to divert from the usual formula,neutral
644,the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy s soap opera deeply characterdriven films are great but only if the characters are compelling and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel the villains dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist the great lt columbo himself is no where near his famous lovable selfeffacing crumpled self and the bridekidnap victim is a whimpering onedimensional damselindistress she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor come on i could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the youknowwhat in seconds in any sense of reality this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little and speaking of realitythe story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police the police give me a break everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case this was no columbo just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt columbo written in and stretched to hours,positive
645,i love columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot a mindbogglingly tedious pointless muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly boredlooking peter falk the plot such as it is just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with one part of the proceedings which i found extremely puzzling or possibly annoying was peter falks character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as lt columbo if the producers insist on keeping columbos first name a secret why couldnt they have omitted this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous like i said this is the pits and all true columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague,neutral
646,loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the it deserved for that matter loyalty to mr falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails even if you forgive all the glaring errors this was just plain the poorest excuse for a madefortv columbo film ever im glad i watched it on tv for free would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print,negative
647,absolute garbage the reason that this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula but because the plot was just pathetic the supposed star didnt do anything to solve the case and neither did anyone else really it was just routine police work utterly tediousyou sat right till the end hoping for a twist and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment there was so much potential in having a relative in apparent kidnap could the lts personal involvement finally cloud his judgement all the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it but surely a genius like lt c by constant conversation with the wronged husband would gradually uncover a fiendish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom surprises the bride hides the body and then plants subtle clues it could have been good it was a complete waste of time,neutral
648,an uninspired and undistinguished new columbo which sees the maninthemac attend his nephews wedding only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night columbo investigatesand that it is about it indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script given that it is written by robert van scoyk who penned the highly enjoyable columbo story murder under glass in the detectives heyday there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to columbo by the scriptwriter is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding which include everybody who was theredevoid of every columbo trait possible i thought i was watching an episode of hill street blues an insult to the history of the series with appropriately soapopera style acting very avoidable stuff,positive
649,most definitely the worst columbo ever dreamt up no murder and the abandonment of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag falk looks bored throughout and so will you be if you waste anytime watching this,negative
650,this show stinks for parents they usually want their kids to watch something good for them it is usually educational funny and brightis it educational no the doodlebops sing and thats it they usually sing about themselves they dont try teaching anythingis it funny no the doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke and laugh at itis it bright its so bright its painful as far as colors everything is extremely bright so thats good but nothing is ever wrong in the world of the doodlebops therefore they are always happy a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sadthe show is also extremely cheesy every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny its overkillfor kids its entertaining but past the age of you wont want your kids to see it theyll never know how to grow up,positive
651,my children watch the show everyday that its on its a great program for younger children however they need to stop showing reruns and do some more actual shows and get rid of rooneys and deedees yellow teeth moe is the only doodle bop with clean white pearlie teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the dont ever brush their teeth does the show ever make its way to the united states and if so where can we find its schedule at and one other thing if we might be able to add moe you need to stop hiding so much sometimes when you pop up out of no where you scare the younger children and whats with the pulling of the rope what does that signify other then getting wet all the time they need to add newer things to their show instead of the same ole same ole kids loose interest that way,neutral
652,normally when i write a review for a movie online it is for one of three reasons either i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent i feel that the publics perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative i find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as this is one of the best films of all time does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good which should be the point of the review in the first place with that being said war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried incompetent attempt at a money grab piggybacking its loathsome carcass on the multimillion dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject this movie is not even so bad that it becomes funny or endearing rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger now with most of the insults out of the way allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film i found it as sams club for bucks i assumed that the cast would be nonames and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular check this is not a big deal for me as i find a large budget and an overreliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score check again what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alienbattle scenes now as per imdbs policy any spoilers must be announced in advance no matter how small so here is fair warning the movie opens with a lot of inane smalltalk followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot seriously it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth but by the end of the first ten minutes the combination of shaky camerawork spliced scenes and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer however the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going the next minutes basically go as follows one of the main characters walks to one of the pods he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot they both walk back to town these walks arent two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie in a particularly grueling scene the main character is shown looking at a pod then he is shown pacing and panting then he looks at the pod then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town then comes in to town and walks into a building then he has a cup of coffee and says thank you mary to a random maid that serves him coffee then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod i apologize for the extreme runon sentence but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film characters speak way too long about mundane things they walk a lot they send other people to walk the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed but for no dramatic effect simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere the editing is mindbogglingly bad people actions make little sense for instance when the professor goes to a farmers house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town the farmer stutters and paces around when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion i have seen better high school video productions finally the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage however it is so awful in technical aspects and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad avoid this film at all costs,neutral
653,i am currently sitting here forcing myself to finish this i figure i blew bux on the vhs might as well suffer for it i remember about or years ago doing a search on the internet for war of the worlds cause of the rumors of the spielberg movie at the time and i missed the old tv series from the early s the website make it out that this was a multimillion dollar budget rendition of the classic book it was going to be a perfect translation perfect crap is more in tune with this filmfirst off the video on this movie was glitched it looked as if i was watching the full motion video from an old mids pc or playstation cdrom video game sadly enough the color quality was similar the acting made shatners classic dramatic pause look damn near shakespearean in quality the cg rendering of various scenes was horrendous and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old dukes of hazardd scenessecondly it is slow and terribly drawn out i sat thru minutes of the video no promos at the beginning before the cylinder actually opened to reveal the first alien after that the alien was a terribly constructed cg squid i am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry i have seen is a spinning silver disk crappy down even attached to a mechanical arm the dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumentals the last thing on that for an alien invasion in the turn of the century s no one is concerned for their life its like they have no concept even though media was slow word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known the illusion of day and night was shoddy at best simply changing the color around the people to purple blue or green does not signify night time perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a much better illusion there is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the hero gallop around or walk down silly roads get on with the film i know how people get around you do not need to be so indepthnow finally an hour and minutes into the film and they show the alien machines mighty morphin power rangers had better looking effects even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student the animations do not match up to the scenery at allin closing folks if you want the war of the worlds do one of four things watch the original watch the early s tv series wait for spielbergs rendition to be released shortly or read the frikkin book something we all probably did in elementary english class avoid this movie it is a waste of your money,neutral
654,i must admit i burst out laughing when i saw one reviewer compare this to lotr well yes if you exclude the dwarfs the cast of thousands the great special effects the big battles the strong characterization the decent plot the good acting the classy direction and everything else which leaves you with the walking and boy does this film do walking if mr piano had his way this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the wisconsin countryside but every minutes or so these pesky martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble youve never seen so much walking in a movie if this really had a m budget most of it must have gone on mr pianos shoes because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does which explains why theres no money left for decent effects a decent video camera or proper actors honestly its like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes even on fastforward this is a looonnnggg walkas for the scifi stuff i think it was a mistake to put martians in the film they only get in the way of the walking which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the storyi wonder how much mr piano charges to walk dogs,positive
655,wowi picked this up at the local walmart after reading online that it had been released early ive been following this online for some time and just had to buy the filmwowi guess the thing that really struck me was the editing or lack thereof time and again characters usually the narrator and whoever he is with are shown walkingand walkingand walking i am not an editor but i do know that you can cut between someone leaving point a to show them arriving at point b there is no need to show almost the entire journey wowi actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this they seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy depending on what action was to be added at a later datewowwhy it was decided to do almost all the effects using cg is beyond me even ilm still employs miniatures sometimes one of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of according to the end credits the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities including london at times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera in one shot in london there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrators brother played by star anthony piana without his distracting mustache not since gettysburg have i seen such a fake piece of facial hairwowwhy timothy hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me it is a turkey plain and simple on the plus side at least for me it has provided some of the most genuine laughoutloud bits of hilarity i have seen in quite a while,neutral
656,is it possible to give a movie no stars i suppose not however many stars imdb displays this just think zero and youll get my drift director and photographer timothy hines didnt have much of a budget compared to spielbergs herculean effort with the same material rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made but that need not be an insurmountable handicap ive seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring soldier and saints is a recent example with hard work integrity and above all talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of wells novella and at fraction of what was spent by dreamworks on its war of the worlds unfortunately hines failed in all these departments even if he had had spielbergs budget and tom cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal hes foisted on usprimarily hines seems unable to tell a story thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records a guy walks down a country lane a lot he talks badly aped received english to some other guy then he walks down the same lane only shot from the back this time to show hes returning clever eh walking and talking for nearly an hour thats all that happens ok ill grant that one extended excursion from the main characters house to the impact site on horsell common to show that its a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful a firstyear film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this btw but half a dozen times back and forth back and forth et cetera et cetera with some yakkityyak in between remarkable the only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish cg works into something that could be offered as a featurelength film finally the martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking or shrieking later we get staggering and wailing for dessertthankfully much of the dialogue is lifted straight from hg wells text else wed have no idea what is going on but is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text to realize what words alone cant convey if a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel why bother why not do a radio play orson welles made himself a household name doing just that however hines thinks hes a filmmaker so hes content to mouth the words and swallow the meaningsecondly hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie but he has no idea how to use them now i for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy i believe good science fiction cinema doesnt need dazzling technical effects some really potent scifis have flourished on virtually none at all but the war of the worlds as film requires a certain baseline effort wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled the effects dont need to be complex they can even be crude eg fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the george palbyron haskins version but they must be handled well unfortunately hines effects are both crude and incompetent tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice and on ad nauseum crude technique is forgivable so you have a cg fire effect thats less than convincing fine we can work around that just dont use it too often and only show glimpses of it that stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum throw it away its not necessary you say your martian flyer looks like a toy on a string if you must use it go ahead but please dont show it twice but no hines wont listen we get the worst looking stuff used again and again gotta get those minutes somehow boynext we have acting or more precisely too much acting whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out evidently hines thinks hes getting a bargain more fleeing in terror over there you quaking behind that tree lets have a real conniption fit this take you call that writhing in agony nonsense my grandmother can writhe better nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink they arent even good amateurs but this neednt prove fatal many a good movie has been made with rancid acting thats what directors are for and editors which brings up another point who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory if americas butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef in spite of the near threehour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie not sequences but single frames creating a herkyjerky effect thats nauseating to watch maybe hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the s if he was i can say he doesnt know how to do it,neutral
657,i honestly believe that anyone considering filmmaking be subjected to this mindboggling failure like the films of edward wood jr in the s and s this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts reediting their films and reworking their special effects until they finally look right this movie is also a decent argument for the studios prescreening process if mr hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience perhaps he would have cut or the walkingrunningstrolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable minutesfilm students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is good enough can truly be every performance every line of dialog every digital effect every filter effect indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity a beginning filmmaker may find himselfherself tempted from time to time to think at least i accomplished something or just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself this movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn outcritics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment the worst movie ever madebeginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites also beginning directors can learn the importance of a good screenplay and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story writers and directors who watch bad madeforcable movies of the week and think i can do better than that can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really is to produce even mediocre resultsi sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers particularly those entering the craft in this current postlucas and postspielberg environment there is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects the war of the worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off some cant even come close to it,neutral
658,after hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is i took the plunge and bought the dvd that said everything previously mentioned about this film is true for a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all the list of problems with the film could drag on forever chief amongst them is the film is simply too long it dragged on for a few minutes short of hours nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly secondly as many had pointed out from the trailers the special effects are anything but special the tripods looked ok in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was gradez s or s quality probably the worst effects of all were the horses which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved the heat ray effects were laughable as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles also pitiful was the thunderchild sequence in which the thunderchild described in the book as an ironclad ram looked nothing of the sort instead it resembled a world war era destroyer complete with deck guns which fired but had no visible crew and torpedo tubes the colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out mars to her in the sky well the sky is black but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight there is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape bathed in full sunlight and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars to detract even further the color of the scenes made no sense in some they are bathed in orange light in others green light in still others its blue light in some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue the framerate and camera is very shaky giving everything a stuttering lookfinally the acting is overall subpar one man portrays two characters whos sole difference was one lacked a mustache this led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were the english accents even to american ears are outrageous in summary this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times i have not seen gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one because of its poor quality in every respect must easily be worse then anything that mainstream hollywood has put out i would not be surprised if the movie makes it to the bottom or in the imdb rankings its a pity that mystery science theater is not still around,neutral
659,nu image ufo and others produce films for the sci fi channel that come in with budgets of roughly million some feature extensive effects work others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both for millionmr hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at million dollars but its painfully obvious that this was probably produced for if not considerably less than that few sets are utilized a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurishits painful to watch not so much because it is poorly directed poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budgetthose of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by pt barnum,neutral
660,i love movies and ill watch any movie all the way through just to give it a chance i can finally say that i found a movie i cant watch all the way through the acting is terribly stale and monotone the cgi looks like a computer geek did it in his mothers basement with minimal software andthe long scenes of justwalking and this movie is three hours long i didnt even make it minutes until i fast forwarded the dvd the scenes with the aliens are very short ummm instead of naming this war of the worlds lets name this war of the walking long distances this cost million dollars to make what they spend the money on the dramatic opening songoh but on a positive note one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people thats hilarious not because people are dying but because when they turn to skeletons they still squirm for seconds afterwardsolike i said if you are a fan of boring stale actionless movies here is one for you dvd collection but i didnt write this for you i wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will hate this movie it is not worth your time or moneyi know this is by the book but the book isnt that long and im a complete book wormnerdgeekwhatever but why just get the steven spielberg version its not all that good but its times better than this i give this a big fat zero out of,neutral
661,finally i thought someone is going to do justice to hg wellss classic not another version set in the wrong locale or era but one based firmly on the book well it definitely follows the book pretty closely and that is the only plus to this messthis is mins yes hours long the book is only around pages if timothy hines had the nerve to come on here and say if you can do any better i would say yes i could and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my lifei paid good money to get this crap over to the uk from the usa do not make the same mistake as me,neutral
662,save the youll spend at walmart to buy this dvd and go see the real film by steven spielbergim a filmmaker and being an avid fan of hg wells i had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment instead it took four days to finish watching this because i couldnt stand watching more than minutes at a time its horriblethere are reports that timothy hines had a million budget for this production where the heck did it go did he use most of it to buy a new house finance his retirement or what let me start with what is actually good about this film it does stay true to the book and there are a few good performances in it i can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film but good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible and i do mean horrible special effects any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the cgi to me most of it looked like stop action card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated cgi software that a million project should be usingtheres no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film my own partner and i sat down and recreated our version of the ferry scene using software that cost less than and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what hines created ive seen films with budgets of less than million look better much betterin my opinion the special effects used in the original king kong were more sophisticated and better than hines special effects in this film in fact i have a much better appreciation for attack of the killer tomatoes because of this film theres no excuse with todays technology for a film to look like a s bmovie unless that was the intention which shouldnt have been with this particular projecta problem i had with the dvd transfer was that the film is jerky another demonstration of amateur filmmakingoverall i have to say that i produced a project in that have better cinematography and special effects than this filmi strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good filmmaking or who is a fan of wotw to leave this film on the shelf and watch attack of the foot woman instead it would be easier on the eyes,positive
663,im not really sure how to even begin to describe how bad this movie is i like bad films as they are often the most entertaining i love bad special effects bad acting bad music and inept direction with the exception of the music which was better than i had expected this movie had all of those qualities the special effects were amazingly bad the worst ive seen since my nintendo some scenes to watch for include the thunderchild the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot the big ben scene the train wreck wow there are so many bad effects on the plus side though some scenes of the alien walkers are well donethe acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been having been based directly on hg wells book for having such good source material its almost as though the actors were trying to be so overthetop as to make it funny and then theres the mustache the single most distracting piece of facial hair ive seen in a long time of course only half the movie contains acting the rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shotsto say that timothy hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors with the use of different colored filters between shots for no particular reason the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes the bad green screening its amazing to me how this man ever got approval to direct a movie i wouldnt imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad a movie bravo mr hines bravo my advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what i did have some friends who enjoy bad movies over drink play poker while watching it keep drinking and maybe youll make it all the way through it does make for an excellent bad movie so have fun and laugh yourself silly with this disaster,neutral
664,holy freaking god allfreakingmighty this movie was so bad i thought i was on drugs in a bad way the character acting is the poorest thing ive seen in quite some time this movie was more akin to lord of the gstrings imhoits a real movie most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen my favorite part was when they are in the carriage and you can tell theres no horse theyre fleeing from alien monsters and going about the same speed as a swift jog then it switches to a farshot with a ridiculous cg horse and the cg in general seems to be subpar to s beyond the minds eye i mean come on really it felt like a horrible episode of hercules only without kevin sorbo there to save the day worst movie ever,negative

666,if this film had a budget of million id just like to know where the money went a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original playstation game and early pc games from the mid s if a game had ever been made what puzzles me is where did the money go pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing or ruining in this case for about the same million this is quite possibly the worst film ever made i would rather sit through a hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again i hated it completely i regress i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan or killer tomatoes or santa claus conquers the martians these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them you love them there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it i sold it to a guy for a dollar im betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew shame on you pendragon films i want my money back,negative
667,i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty and i can honestly say i feel violated i had read the reviews and heard the warnings and i thought i was prepared for anything at best i thought a faithful if misguided attempt at an original adaptation at worst a sogooditsbad plan for the new millennium so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk i joked to my friends prepare for the worst movie ever made oh cruel karma there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film the special effects look like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx the acting is terrible the accents are worse than terrible one artillery mans accent seems to take us on a tour of the british isles from scotland to wales via northern ireland the dialogue is stilted the editing is nonexistent the production values prove that no expense has been gone to words really cannot describe how bad this movie is from the union flag flying from the horribly cgid thunderchild the royal navy flies the white ensign not the union flag to the woodworm ridden acting this is quite simply a crime against film making when you consider some of the literallyzerobudget fan films that are available on the net the star wars short troops for example the whole were enthusiastic amateurs argument goes right out of the window and if you believe an interview with hines on the pendragon website this film had an figure budget i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the us maybe the problem is that hines co tried to make a film of the book rather than turn the book into a film if that makes any sense characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words ironically enough the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was darlene sellers the exsoft porn actress my advice pray like crazy that jeff wayne doesnt screw up and go watch the spielberg version it may not be true to the text of the book but i can say this as a lifelong hg wells fan and englishman as well speilbergs film is true to the spirit of the book maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country but i will say this timothy hines stole three hours of my life and i want them back,neutral
668,well on its credit side if it can be said to have one timothy hines did manage to capture the original setting of hg wells outstanding novella but other than that well to call a spade a spade it sucks bigtime what the master ed wood could have done with the alleged million dollar budget timothy hines really does make mr wood who was a flawed genius anyway look like the best filmmaker of all time the special effects i guess youd call them that are not even up to computer game standards the acting is well perhaps about dinner theater comparable and the accents are atrocious at the risk of sounding offensive a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is especially poor ogilvy well ahem gay poor ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus english countryside waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor hey the stormtroopers in star wars had neat white body armor too and it didnt work either they still got blasted even when ogilvy and company get fried by the martians heat ray they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance even when theyre theoretically dead and reduced to skeletons which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing maybe timothy hines rented the skeletons from ray harryhausen being left over from jason and the argonauts or was it josie and the pussycats i dunno the soldiers presumably because theyre military all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him wow i loved it but the soldiers all looked like they were either fascist troops from the spanish civil war or boer commandos which would be more or less correct for the period perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius hines oddly enough the character of the curate looks exactly like hes drawn in the original illustrations by warwick goble and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting oh yeah musnt forget the thunder child in the book the warship is described as an ironclad torpedoram it was meant to ram enemy ships yet its bow was crumpled after ramming the tinkertoy constructed martian war machines with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak and she sank an ironclad warship like thunderchild couldve rammed the titanic and survived but i guess the royal navy was bound by the same lowestbidder constraints as our own military the costumes are all wrong especially the british army and police uniforms cobbled together mostly from usmc alphas and timbo in an obvious homage to western films of yore has obviously set his movie in wild western england because all his riders are using western saddles the accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of scottish regional accent used by clan macabre and magically delicious irish accents from county malarky on the credit side and contrary to what one reviewer wrote the only genuine authentic feature of this thing is the artillery the guns are not from the civil war but appear to my eye and research as bonafide british nine or pounder rifled breach loaders perfectly authentic to the period so was the ammunition shown being used but the artilleryman who is a driver in the horse artillery was not shown correctly driving his limber you dont sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team you ride the nearside wheel horses the opening using what i believe is authentic period film footage is okay and the scores not bad however to the best of my knowledge weybridge has never had an underground and it certainly didnt in but growing up reading this novel i am very disappointed even more disappointed then i was at spielbergs zillion dollar special effects laden version maybe his version would have profited by swapping anthony piana for tom cruise and vice versa i have a lot more to say but ill let it go at this for now i wish somebody would make a good version of war of the worlds thats faithful to the original timmys vision is fine for a high school film class or maybe i should say pretentiously stupid for a collegelevel film student and about as bad which is about the best i can say for this thing but thats about it oh yeah just where did the budget go and what happened to michael caine id like to hear his comments i have a sneaking suspicion that timbo orson wood hines breathtaking boundbreaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risktaking directors ticket to cult stardom because i must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie which i didnt pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a dvd copy for me with no malicious intent that ive been able to determine i must add here that i thought blackmoons dubbed and abridged

671,wowi just was given this film from a friend of mine who bought it for at walmart and he felt that he got taken it is beyond boring most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen the acting is somewhat improvised almost as if they didnt have a script the martians are cgi which look like they were done by a novice or a fan produced movie i cannot stress just how bad this dvd really isexample in one of the scenes the martians are torturing a local female captive she goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a cgi copy of that woman the change is totally noticeable and when she is killed you can see that it is a computer figure looking like something from a game back in if at all possible avoid this movie like the plague you can download two trailers from their site and see how godawful it really is,neutral

674,this movie was crap with a capital c the opening scene showed promise but that promise was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is goingand the wooden statue morty who was rather creepy in the original film looks plain goofy in this one it was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume and by the way who else thinks morty is one of the most unscary names on planet earth it ranks right up there with jimmy or fred when it comes to horror value or why not just name the wooden statute henryfreakinkissinger run its dr kissinger thatd be about as scary as mortyand then theres a scene where the hero hits his fathers tombstone witha sledgehammer you might guessa twobyfour someone might venture no he angrily beats his fathers tombstone with a twiga freakin twig but worse than that once the characters walk away the tombstone actually and inexplicably bleeds oh brothertheres also a native american guy who lives with the main characters grandparents but apparently does nothing except mortymaintenance he perpetuates creepy mortylegends warns those who scoff and even fixes mortys arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank but for all his respect for and tenderness toward morty does morty give a rats hairy behind nothe movie drags on and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears sort of this film is a real yawner dont rent it,negative
675,those of you who like me were disappointed with the original horror yarn the fear will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel it sort of follows a similar plot but it is impossible to connect to the original with the exception of the presence of morty the mannequin monster made of wood here is a brief overviewtwenty years after mike hawthorne gordon currie in a decent performance witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life mike is still suffering from the fear of that day in hopes of ridding his fear mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents home his plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears and then present the fears to the mannequin morty according to an indian friend this process is supposed to magically take away ones fear what mike doesnt know is that morty is possessed with his fathers spirit and begins killing off the friendsor is it really mike himself doing the killings who caresa have a few troubles with this film the first lies with morty i thought the original made morty look rather convincing this time it is painfully obvious morty is a man actor jon fedele in a fake looking suit this can especially be seen in early scenes where morty is still supposed to be inanimate but if you watch closely you can see him blinking another trouble is that most of the characters dont try hard enough some of them do namely betsy palmer of friday the th fame who was excellent in this film but most of them dont make the effort or werent given the chance finally there are the killings the opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing actually when i saw them i thought i was in for a good movie when the second half of the movie arrives and the killings really start everything falls to pieces deaths are either uncreative unseen or foreseen glimpses of the next scene as currie has a blackout one character dies in the end and no one including the viewer even notices while more characterization was needed in the beginning half it wasnt too bad the second half was i think new director chris angel got to this point and really didnt know how to shoot the violent scenes so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian a silly ending doesnt help either thus unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin you should probably skip the fear halloween night zanatos score out of,neutral

681,i am really shocked that a great director like chuck jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons ive ever seen i did not laugh once throughout this short and its a bugs bunny cartoon for christs sake bugs bunny cartoons are always funny not boring alas this short turns out to be good night elmer another incredibly boring jones short with the addition of bugs bunnythe first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff good night elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff this cartoon on the other hand is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon theres too much dialogue the cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue at one point elmer finishes eating dinner and comments that was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb possibly the most redundant dialogue ive ever heard in a cartoon characters reading text out loud in the laterera woody woodpecker cartoons doesnt count in my book even though this cartoon is only minutes long it feels like thanks to redundant dialogue like thiselmers pet rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me but if youve sold your soul to chuck jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career you might enjoy it,neutral
682,i am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators to me it was rather a disappointment especially the combination of historical facts fantasy and the main characters internal turmoil does not work at all in vonneguts book slaughterhouse five and even in george roy hills adaptation for the screen it does credibility is often overstretched too many questions are left open did i miss some central points or did i fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots a boy called campbell jr grows up in upstate new york at home his father has many technical trade papers and one book it has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it the boy leafs through the book his dad doesnt like his doing that what should this tell me the family moves away from upstate new york to berlin bang it is the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright what kind of plays does he write in what language is he successful his wife is an actress and looks glamorous the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same he does not why because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american because he is successful because his wife is because he likes his life there because he likes the nazis because he is just plain lazy and doesnt like change dont ask mepossibly the man just does not care is not interested in politics is a kind of an existentialist he states that he is deeply in love with his wife he speaks of his republic of two meaning he and his wife there is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie it much more seems a republic of oneon the request of an american agent campbell jr agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short unexciting and anti climactic the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fastso now we have campbell jr presenting himself over the air as the last free american the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting although one wonders what happened when campbell jr really and honestly had to cough hiccup etc must have scrambled the messages terribly anyway the nazis lose the wife dies touring in the crimean for german troops i never heard such tours really happened on german front lines in ww ii campbell jr says he goes to the russian front but does not go is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug how come is dragged to a sightseeing tour in auschwitz is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new yorkand this is where the story really starts bang from now on it is like a short story by paul auster it is campbell jr lives in new york tenement as a hasbeen and mourns the loss of his wife nobody really cares or do they yes somehow they do and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction auschwitz survivors a painter some american supremacists discover him and want him to be their figurehead they even find his presumed dead wife for him or is she his wife anyway in the end campbell jr calls in at the israeli consulate and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmanns he writes his life story and once this task finished hangs himself on the typewriters ribbons without getting sooty the least bitwhile i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss amazingly many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american i assume according to them this took a lot of courage as a matter of fact however the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a winwin situation as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war the danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the storyone might argue that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything but even then it fails to make a point primarily i suspect because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat this is a pity especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee a talented versatile and sensuous actress she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts confession broadcast and hidden messages but i guess this is largely unfilmable maybe i should give the book a chance,neutral
683,this was an awful movie not for the subject matter but for the delivery i went with my girlfriend at the time when the movie came out expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression what we saw was hours of brutal police oppression with no uplift at the end the previews and ads made no mention of this plus for all that they played up whoopi goldberg my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first minutes again the previews say nothing about this not that you would expect that but its just more of the problem if i had known how depressing this movie would be i wouldve never have seen it or at least i wouldve been prepared for it this was a bait and switch ad campaign and i will never see this movie again,negative
684,the concept for sarafina appears to be a sound one that is aside from the musical perspective it attempts to combine upbeat african music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set the contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers dont exactly sit well next to the songs aside from the poor premise the acting isnt the best either goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast overall a disappointment,neutral
685,i just didnt get this moviewas it a musical nobut there were choreographed songs and dancing in itwas it a serious dramano the acting was not good enough for thatis whoopi goldberg a quality serious actordefinently noti had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie the message on apartheid and the tribute to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worsesee for yourself but in fairness i hated it,negative
686,one scene demonstrates the mentality of terminator woman pretty well karen sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villains camp karen runs across an armed guard who points his gun at her but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight karen kicks him in the balls picks up the gun and runs away then again when a film is directed by a martial artist and written produced by another member of his family you know you shouldnt expect too much karen sheperd and jerry trimble do get some amusing banter going early on and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their lovehate relationship but after about minutes they get separated and the film slows to a crawl and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up it lacks excitement the finale has trimble fighting qissi inside a cave and sheperd going womanoawomano against the beautiful ashley hayden on a speedboat but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value on the positive side kudos to the costuming department for giving karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film,positive
687,this film has got several key flaws the first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life this means that the film cannot captivate its audience instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it in short it really is very very very very very very very bad do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe youll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching terminator woman,positive
688,you may want to know up front that i am not a mormon unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film i mention this so youll understand that the way i look at the film may differ greatly from those in the faith for some being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faithand that is not my intention so my review is that of an outsider trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were well after seeing the film i doubt if i have learned much at all since i have been a history teacher i have a good basic understanding about young as well as joseph smith as well as the teachings of the church but anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so goshdarn nicetoo nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal plus you learn practically nothing about the churchs beliefs other than they are nice people work hard and some have many wives and this latter part is only barely hinted at in the film instead the people are almost cartoonlike in their simplistic portrayals joseph smith and brigham young and their followers are angelic the nonmormons were all devils and brian donlevy playing exactly the same sort of role edward g robinson later played in the ten commandments is the troublemaker who claims to be a mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy its all so very simpletoo simple almost like an indoctrination film or infomercialbrigham young especially was a very complex manwith many good points an excellent organizer and visionary as well as bad dont even get me started on his views about blacks within the church or intermarriage to portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly its also a lot like how gandhi was portrayed in the film with ben kingsleyonly the facts that led to his being almost superhuman were emphasized heck now that i think about that this is the trouble with most religious filmsthey often come off as onedimensional trite and bland lets have a full and more complete film of these menone that will stick to facts and not emotional appealsnow if you can ignore the fact that you wont learn very much about the faith or its second leader the film is enjoyable enough its obvious someone at th centuryfox really cared about the film as they had a wonderful cast of both premier actors tyrone power up and coming actors linda darnell jane darwell and vincent price and wonderful character actors dean jagger john carradine and brian donlevy the film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of gloss it just didnt have a lot to tell us other than they were all swell plus there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes a few of the mistakes include young taking over the helm immediately after the death of joseph smith it was three years later no mention of the various mormon denominations and splinter groups talk of gold in californiaeven though it was and gold wouldnt be discovered until as well as no specific mention of polygamy or smiths many wives just plain dumb scenes include carradine pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom sceneand no one seemed to careeven though it was a very hostile audience dont you think at least the judge would tell him to put it away and stop threatening people with itone final comment do not i repeat do not watch this film when its shown on american movie classics a one great station that has sunk a lot in recent years while i am critical of the film because of its simplistic message i was horrified with the complete disrespect the station had for the church and its traditions what i mean is this the film was punctuated with ads for penis enlargement formulas as well as tons of popups some advertising a show that features the sexiest cast talk about disrespectful and gross and i would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film by doing this they not only insult the faith but marginalize their marketafter all who is into hearing about these things and the life of brigham young is this a movie in this form that you can show to your kids or recommend to others,neutral
689,this film though ostensibly a comedy is deadly serious its subject is imperialism with a capital i how britain foolishly humiliatingly tries to convince itself that its still a great power after world war ii at home the empire is run by amiable dolts benevolent tories who are so inbred that they cant distinguish close relatives the offices of government consist of long forgotten archives a dig at orwellian paranoia inhabited by indolent rats and anterooms wherein lounge bored synacures reading popular novelsabroad britain clings to the old pomp but pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly especially when its embodied in bumbling twits carltonbrowne is an unsentimental picture of decline with none of the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly antiimperialist jewel in the crownthe film is also about the cold war bravely admitting that its a dangerous farce whose participants deserve mockery and contempt not fear and respect its about how colonialism characterised more by neglect than tyranny destroys the colonies it deserts robbing them of amenities power and most importantly selfrespect leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboysits the seriousness of course that kills it thats not to say that weighty subjects cant be treated in comedy the miracle of morgans creek dr strangelove and the life of brian have all proved that indeed one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy it allows for a clearereyed viewthe problem with carltonbrowne is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny in the three films mentioned above much of the comedy arises from character reaction to an extreme situation not the extreme situation itself here the script is too poor to sustain rich comic characterisations and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled peter sellers terrythomas raymond huntley and john le mesurier are criminally wastedterrythomas sublime so often shows that he couldnt handle lead parts and that he needed to play sneering arrogant bounders not brainless toffs the music is made to carry much of the comedy but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen to be fair unlike the majority of british comedies of the period which were stagy and underproduced the boultings often try to make their points through film itself by montage and composition only huntley manages to raise genuine laughs and thats by essaying a character he could have played in his sleepnone of the boultings farces have dated well theyre never thought through enough although carltonbrowne revels in the decline of the empire it also seems to be antidemocratic and militaristic im sure this wasnt intended but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form,neutral
690,the main reason people still care about carltonbrowne of the fo is that it features peter sellers in a secondbilled role but watching this film to see peter sellers is a mistakesellers plays amphibulos a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirtpoor island nation of gaillardia formerly a british colony now hosting a lot of russian diggers during the height of the cold war amphibulos wants to play both uk and soviet interests against each other for easy profit everything very friendly and all our cards under the table terrythomas is the title character a lazy british diplomat anxious to show gaillardia that great britain hasnt forgotten them all appearances to the contrarya positive review here says the reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated i would argue that the reason carltonbrowne is considered below average is because the comedy is nonexistentafter a decent opening that establishes the films only two strengths a sympathetically doltish terrythomas and john addisons fullon larky score things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes the low opinion of carltonbrowne by his boss and the obscurity of gaillardia which no one can find on a map is milked to death by the time we actually reach the island after a labored series of airsick jokes expectations are quite lowtheyre still too high though the island itself which seems to exist either in latin america or the mediterranean is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade the army is apparently still horse drawn allowing for another lame aural gag by a thickaccented announcer in war the army uses many horsesellers never quite takes center stage even when were on his characters island the plot is taken over instead by ian bannen as king loris who inherits the throne of gaillardia after his fathers assassination bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written normally this would make him the likely target for scenestealing by sellers but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year the mouse that roared and im all right jackstrange that this film like jack was a boulting brothers production with roy boulting here serving as codirector alongside jeffrey dell usually boulting films combine wicked social satire with anythinggoes comedy but here there are only fey jabs in either direction amphibulos works his mangledenglish vibe for all its worth this man is like how do you say the bull in the chinese ship while carltonbrowne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deservethe weakest and most protracted element of the film is young loriss romance with ilyena score one point for her being played by ravishing luciana paluzzi dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressedthe film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one and a final bit of action by carltonbrowne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally apparently he lives to see another day but the film of the same name is strictly doa,neutral
691,it was meant to be a parody on the lotrtrilogy but this was one of the most awful movies ive ever seen bad acting bad screenplay bad everything this is my personal opinion i dont doubt any second that there are people wholl like this sense of humor but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as mel brooks or the zucker brothers im working in a movie theater and in dvd shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas at the movies it was a nice but no big at all success during the first two weeks but then when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good the movie dropped very fast in dvd sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore in the last ten years the two worst movies ive seen are the ring thing and torque i cant decide which one was worse but im happy that there a so many good movies so i dont have to think too much on this question,neutral
692,this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is absolutely no storyline the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching in the whole movie fredi oh my god what a funny name ha ha doesnt ask himself once how he came from a plane to middle earth there are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny eg gandalf is called almghandi sam is called pupsi and so on i didnt even smile once during the whole movie the gags seem like they were made by people whose iq is negative if you laugh when someones coat is trapped in the door this happens about times then this movie is perhaps for you another funny scene they try to guess the code word for a closed door dont ask why dont ever ask why in this movie and the code word is ha ha dung so if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie for everybody else go to youtube and watch lord of the weed its a lot lot more fun,neutral
693,this sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb nazis occult government conspiracies i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves instead you get something quite different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually a plus but the way the story is told is just awfulpart of the trouble is the casting andrienne barbeaus character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid she just doesnt do that well even at her age though she certainly tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie or at least acted like it rather than simply being quirky the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter siri barucanother big part is the pacing it starts off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughters suicide and the aftermath but shortly afterward it all becomes a jumbled mess some of this was on purpose but much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focusedthe real problem is its simply not a pleasant movie to watch its slow dull none of the characters are likable overuse of imagery and sets some movies you see characters get tortured in this its the viewer that does it does have a few creepy moments most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome,neutral
694,this is a movie of tired yet weirdly childish clichs theres a nazi witch master performing sfrelated experiments in the basement oh please aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright not having any expectations beforehand i am left with an aged xander from buffy and a heroine with apelike face who doesnt seem to know how to act said adrienne barbeau have i only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable cannibal women in the avocado jungle of deathcamera and editing adds to the general impression of lame,neutral
695,can i please say first of all that i felt so strongly about this movie that i signed up to imdb specifically to review it and my review this is easily the worst movie i have ever seenthe synopsis of the movie sounded interesting nazis occult time travel etc but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together remember the episode of south park that featured manatees writing family guy using idea balls did these manatees also write unholy its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas but had no idea how to link them all together and then to make things make even less sense included a donnie darkoesquire time travel theme to the ending messing up the chronologyi could tell from early on that this was a bad movie special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to dvd the acting wasnt great but in fairness ive seen worse i will praise the nazi paintings they were creepy but the evil nazi butcher guy was just comici dont have a vendetta against this movie or anything but to be honest im not even into the horror genre but this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama if this story had been well told this would have been a good movie but it has been over hyped waaaaay over hyped,neutral
696,when i started watching this movie i saw the dude from buffy xander and figured ah how nice that hes still making a living acting in movies now a weird movie i can stand given that its a good dose of weird like for example david lynch movies twin peaks lost highway etc and you sort of have to be in the mood for one this one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theorys that make absolutely no sense i mean come on people nazis who conspire with america to make an unholy trinity of evil powers i was surprised they didnt mention the hollow earth in this movie with hitler flying saucers and lizard people maybe if you had like grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense but seriously i dont condone drugs like i dont condone this movie it should be burned shredded and forgotten just so good ol xander might get another acting job it wasnt his acting though that was alright but the script just didnt make any sense sorry,negative
697,im not sure this is a spoiler perhaps it is a public service if you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcers voiceover which states the us has just surrendered to nazi germany on may to end wwii here are just a few of the problems with this close the older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more unholy movies in their minds eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusionthe average person will really kick themselves that they did not watch one of these unholy fillintheblanks flicks created in their own head for free instead of shelling out time and money to see this unholy from the video store or on cablethis end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about wwii leading them to the conclusion that george w bush is the latest heir to the nazi throne,positive
698,i read rices novel with interest and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truthshowever i was simply appalled at this disastrous adaptation the casting was based merely on physical appearance and not acting talent with the obvious exception of peter gallagher who was neither blondhaired or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag the casts embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a french accent was hilarious but not in an entertaining way i found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe and was surprised i made it to the enda warning to fans of the novel stay away from this one,neutral
699,this movie was so badly written directed and acted that it beggars belief it should be remade with a better script director and casting service the worst problem is the acting you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished professional and totally believable and on the other hand richard who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning and keeping couple although both normally do fine work the actors and director should not have attempted to do accents at allthey are inconsistent and unbelievable much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english the casting is ludicrous why have children of an african merchant thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society been cast with very pale skinned actors while the supposedly socially desirable marcel has pronounced african features including an obviously dyed blond fro its as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color its just so weird this could be a great movie and should be remade but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors there are plenty of good actors out there and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast good script and decent direction,positive

704,a slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of neworleans black women by white men of power and privilege ooh does that whet your appetite well then belly up to a vhs or dvd and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history for good measure its adapted from the book by celebrated hack anne rice the directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog most of acting is amateurish the productions sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors all of whom have scarcely been in employed in todays market jasmine guy ben vereen pam grier eartha kitt including some faces that have barely been seen at all bianca lawson rachel cuttrell it also is despite itself a sterling showcase for nicole lyn the pompous and ponderous james earl jones is onhand as well so is the late ossie davis a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary negro ensemble company this film should be rated t for tripe,neutral
705,college students who are clearing out a condemned dormitory are stalked by an elusive killerthe dorm that dripped blood aka pranks is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans the movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine theres even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring in fact much of the storys buildup is pretty forgettable save for one or two brutal murders but the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax in an atmospheric setting and one fairly bold unconventional conclusionthe cast is lackluster for the most part stephen sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character also look for a young daphne zuniga as an illfated studentover all this is a pretty standard b slasher effort but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete hohum out of,positive
706,daphne zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher and the light fades quickly if not her than what other reason to watch this five college kids are signed up to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is soliciting and the group are short a few people then a killer is on the loose i honestly wanted to say i was going to enjoy this one it had a fair set up or maybe that was just daphne zuniga in it the film is too slow and almost as silent as a library most of the acting is below average and the pointofview moments are so old news acclaimed composer christopher young of such films as hellraiser and entrapment scored this in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a tv movie still it seems higher than the movie deserves so other than young and zuniga this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel,neutral
707,over christmas break a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the dorms to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings to make the work a bit more difficult a murderous chuckswearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm preying on the group in various violent waysregistered as one of the video nasties listed by the uk in the s the dorm that dripped blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing the term video nasty strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore violence sex etc all the things a horror fan dreams of so after hearing all of that info i settled into pranks alt title expecting a sleazy slasher experience and thats what it tried to be but failed pretty much completely visually the films not great the cinematography gore except for a couple scenes and overall direction all fail its simply not enjoyable to watch the unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason like the opening kill there are some cool death scenes including a pretty nice face melt which can be seen on the poster but thats about it for the positive the acting is pretty bad the story seems unimportant the killer isnt cool or scary and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid its a bit boring overall for a film done by a few ucla film students for which would be over double that today the dorm that dripped blood isnt a total mess it has a couple good things and is fairly watchable but as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like the house on sorority row and pieces it just cannot compare dont expect much and you may at least be entertained i hate to say it but this is one of the few films ive seen that would actually be better with a remake and yet they go after great works like black christmas oh well obligatory horror elements subgenre slasher violencegore there are some brutally cool kills and the gore is okay for the most part but nothing special also they offscreened some of the best murders sexnudity theres a little unappealing to me nudity but not very much cool killers nah the ending monologues of the killer made himher pretty uncool scaressuspense a jump scare or two but nothing too effective mystery i suppose yeah but i simply didnt care enough and its as obvious as the nose on the killers face final verdict bah humbug ap,neutral
708,im not looking for quality im just trying to get through the famous video nasties that were banned in britain this one was initially banned and rereleased in with a whole seconds cutsome college kids spend their christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation there are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids which of them is the slasher the actual killings are not very gory so this video nastie is not really nasty there is the requisite flashing of the boobies but it has nothing to do with the college kidsi had a suspect very quickly and i turned out to be right maybe ive seen too many of these the end twist was clever i have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality,positive
709,probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever badly acted and badly writtenthe plot five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper john hemmitt played by woody roll or could it be one of the five charactersacting not that bad not that great either apart from daphne zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine and the rest well quite dull although laura lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the endthe kills cant really see why they banned this the kills look fake mostly one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned aliveoverall not really a great slasher could have been a lot better,negative
710,an uninteresting addition to the stalk n slash cycle which dominated the horror genre in the s this was filmed as pranks but released as the dorm that dripped blood which is an obvious steal from the horror anthology the house that dripped blood daphne zuniga is the only recognisable face in the cast and this was her first horror movie she has also appeared in the initiation and the fly ii,positive
711,the two things are are good about this film are its two unknown celebritiesfirst daphne zuniga in her first appearance in a film young and supple with looks that still encompass her body today steals the very beginning which is all she is in and that is that she is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projectssecond the score by then known composer christopherchris young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one staryeah i know one star more is not much but in this movies case it is a lotthe rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer blah blah blahwe all know where this is goingwatch the first eighteen minutes with daphne zuniga then turn it off,neutral
712,eh not a particular good slasher flick soso acting effects decent yet familiar and uninventive soundtrackthere are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything goes apart from that theres a lot of characters wandering around not realizing whats going on or chasing after red herrings more killing of time than of people there are other deaths and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer not partial to any one implement the killer also likes to set other people up to kill innocent people as well the identity isnt revealed towards the end and motive is pretty thin and we really dont caresupposedly the movie takes place around christmas but this isnt a major factor one scene gets lit by christmas lights thats about itthe movie is rather dark with a muddy picture most of the time at least on the videotape i watched some of the dialog got a little lost in some of the opening scenes the ending should have been stronger than it was we think we realize what happened although theres a chance something else did,positive
713,i heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early s movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see well i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as april fools day friday th and prom night this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting instead the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste i was disappointed in his part in the end as far as the true identity of the killer goes when the identity was released as to who he was i just laughed but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but dont spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory,neutral
714,its the early s theres a group of suspiciously oldlooking teens and theres a maniac stalking around yes this is slashervillethis movie is called pranks why is it called pranks i havent the faintest idea unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someones dinner with a baseball bat on balance not a great prank in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told but there you gothe film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory they become aware that a psychopath is on the loose to combat this development they split up and wander about in the dark it ends in tears for most of thempranks is a badly made slasher movie the dvd release i viewed was the vipco one it appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence this makes the dvd even more pointless because lets face it a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time for slasherfilm and video nasty completists only,neutral
715,nb spoiler warning such as it isfirst off this is a teen slasher flick the spaminacabin genre as joe bob briggs piquantly put it if youre looking for roshambo this isnt it and wasnt going to be it im desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography directing or acting performancessecondly this wasnt zunigas first horror flick it was her first screen appearance period cinema tv whatever for what it is worth neither is daphne zuniga susan sarandon or katherine hepburnthirdly you have to give even a lame slasher flick props sure it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof and the harvest time is nowexcept this one gives the chop to the sweet virginal protagonist as well now there is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions interesting that this was said ingenues only film role another one hit wonder except that term gives the lass too much creditthen again this film probably has one of the highest percentage of onemovie actors in history of the nineteen credited actors a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film three appeared in one other movie by the same producers only one other besides zuniga has as many as six screen credits what was this the has been and never were mutual aid societygranted i saw this a long time ago on late night cable when i was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again but i see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with joanne,neutral
716,one of a multitude of slashers that appeared in the early eighties pranks is notable only for an early performance by daphne zuniga the sure thing the fly her character dies fairly early on and the rest of the film is totally forgettableduring their christmas break a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned college building of its furniture a crazy killer however throws a spanner in the works by methodically bumping off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome waysexploiting every stalk n slash clich in the book director jeffrey obrow delivers a tedious and unexciting horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed so that i could get on with watching something more worthwhile the majority of the deaths which lets face it is why we generally watch this kind of film are brief and not that gory the only truly grisly imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor there is one notably bloody dismembered corpsethe film couldve done with moreat the last minute the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending but this really is one for slasher completists only,neutral
717,this one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre slasher movies but its surely a damn bad moviethe holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates its poor production values and stupid plot i mean the subgenre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far there is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to addthe clichs are more than boring the gore is minimal and so does the mysterythis is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldnt be hyped even if it has a video nastie labeli am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash,negative
718,if youve ever seen an eighties slasher there isnt much reason to see this one originality often isnt one of slasher cinemas strongpoints and its something that this film is seriously lacking in there really isnt much that can said about pranks so ill make this quick the film was one of the films included on the dpp video nasty list and that was my only reason for seeing it the plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at christmas time as theyre in a slasher someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie the fact that this movie was on the video nasty list is bizarre because despite a few gory scenes this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone and gorier slashers than this friday the th for example didnt end up banned but then again theres banned films that are much less gory than this one the witch who came from the sea for example anyway the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it as although the audience really couldnt care less who the assailant is by this point it is rather well done on the whole this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss,negative
719,what the is this this must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever i know you cant set your expectations for an s slasher high but this is too stupid to be true i baught this film for and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back can you imagine who hard it stinks who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations well actually you couldnt possible care less and why should you the makers of this piece of garbage sure didnt care they didnt try to create a tiny bit of tension the director stephen carpenter i guess its much easier to find money with a name like that also made the kindred wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors complete crap as well but at least that one had eliza dushku this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga who yeah thats right the melrose place chick her very memorable character dies about min after the opening credits shes the second person to die the first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares the rest of the actorsthey dont deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting youre hoping they die a quick and painful deathand not only their charactersmy humble opinion,neutral
720,ive always liked fred macmurray andalthough her career was tragically cut shorti think carole lombard is fun to watch pair these two major and attractive stars together add top supporting players like jean dixon anthony quinn dorothy lamour and charles butterworth give them a romantic script team them with noted director mitchell leisen and you get a mediocre movie experienceskid johnson fred and maggie carole meet cute during her visit to the panama canal and spend the next few weeks falling in love skids a great trumpeter so he embarks on a musical career which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall during his climb to musical stardom he neglects maggie who later inspires him to start over after hes hit rock bottom ah yes its the true hollywood happy ending which comes none too soonstars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success but this movie is so predictable and slowpaced that its difficult to watch at times the early scenes set in panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in new york fred and carole try their best but the tired script and slow direction just dont give them a chance even the final scene in which maggie encourages skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment just doesnt ring truethis movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard however i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about hours,positive
721,i am a big fan of fred macmurray and carole lombard and in addition to them charles butterworth a very enjoyable supporting actor was in this filmso why didnt i particularly enjoy it well despite a good cast this is one of the poorest written and most clichd a pictures i have ever seen given the talent and money spent to make this film it is shocking how slipshod the writing was i knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film i found myself predicting exactly what would happen nextand i was always right and this isnt because i am some sort of movie savant but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it in fact it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichs all strung together also i found it a bit irritating that fred mistreated carole so bad throughout the film and yet true to convention she came running to him in the end uggh there is more suspense in a lassie film will he bring people to rescue timmy or will the rope he is dangling from breakdespite the very very tired and clichd script there were a few positives about the film it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the filmit was pretty believable and he looked like he hadnt eaten shaved or slept in days also charles butterworths prattle did provide a few mildly humorous moments but all this just wasnt enough to make this film look any different than a b movie its a shameit could have been so much better,neutral
722,in what would be his first screenplay based on his own short story turn about william faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty sacrifice and really strange relationships the story originally was about only the tone young and cooper characters but mgm needed to put joan crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract and faulkner obliged by creating a female role crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her costars young and tone leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraphlike shorthand that sounds like a monty python sketch wuthering heights performed in semaphore seriously the almost entirely pronounless sentences make ernest hemingway read like henry jamesthe film also reflects some familiar faulkner themes with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister as may be found in his sanctuary and elsewhere when young proposes to crawford in tones presence in lieu of an engagement ring all three exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another the closeness of tone and young is also noticeable especially as they go off to their thelma louise fate frankly its creepynot as creepy to this new yorker however as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach wellington which crawford cheerfully catches and which is shown gamboling over her handsi had to turn away and young turns into a gladiator blechthat being said there are some nice performances young is particularly engaging in a scene where hes taken up in coopers fighter plane and roscoe karns is delightful as coopers flying buddy tone despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue has a nice moment dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy youngs fate crawford stripped of meaningful dialogue as well mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic which is quite a balancing act for one rolethe battle scenesnot surprisingly for a howard hawks filmare the most exciting part of the entire picture but not enough as far as im concerned this is minutes of my life im never going to get back,positive
723,my wife and i thought that with this cast and director the movie would have to be at least worth watching we were wrong in fact we gave up on it after minutes the idea that crawford young and tone are british but speak with american accents was for me impossible to get past hard to believe this is england when no one talks with a british accent there is zero chemistry between crawford and anyone and to echo a previous comment the idea that cooper and crawford suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous there is no reason to care about any of the characters which is why we threw in the towel halfway through i found it hard to believe that hawks directed this as none of the actors spoke with the trademark hawksian ratatat delivery so save your time and skip this one,negative

726,please note i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film i saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky considering some indicate that the original version was longer and without crappy dubbing my review must be read with this in mindalthough i know that rene clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and louise brooks has a bit of a cult following as well this is in many ways a technically poorly made film while hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around up through the early to almost the mids a lot of famous french films were essentially silent filmswith some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film the lip movements in many and in particular this film dont even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an american like ms brooks could do a french film this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent filmand as a silent film this is would have been an average filmwith excellent camera work at times and some decent silentstyle actingthe problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot for a silent morality play circa it would have been fine but by standards the plot is a bit hoary that means oldnot slutty a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fianc cant handle it she gives it all up temporarily but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end a tad melodramatic huh and also a bit simplistic and underdevelopedfinally the character of the fiancs friend i found very disturbing and unreal he looked like harold lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received meanspirited were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused this seems to me thats what is implied and i dont like it at allthere are far better french films of the era le million la femme du boulanger fanny regain and others as well as better silent films i just cant understand this films high rating,positive
727,this review may contain some spoilersjust when you thought they didnt make them so extremely bad anymore along comes rae dawn chong as a space vixen and willie nelson as a native american witchdoctor its even worse when you factor in that these two are the better aspects of starlight a film that should only be viewed for laughschong is an alien sent to earth to seek out the only remaining halfbreed part man and part alien apparently the earth is in dire straits something is wrong with the genetics of mankind and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland only by duplicating the dna of the halfbreed can the kindly alien race save the planet dont ask me how that is since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution which is caused by humans you would think earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures not saving them anyway the halfbreed turns out to be billy wirth a man living in a small southwestern town and is part native american from his mothers line despite the fact that his mother is a redheaded caucasian and his grandfather is willie nelson wasnt this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic carmen electra bomb the chosen one such a howler chong arrives in her ship just as wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend before you can say utter the word hogwash chong is revealing her secret to wirth who isnt surprised for a moment and spreading the word to wirths family chong also makes pals with wirths mother who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years well this is because wirths father was an alien that abandoned her of course he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to earth for wirth so he can use wirths dna to make the people of earth his slaves huh his laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie not only are they boring but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the mostthe ideas might be nice on paper but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien but the effects are the bane of the movie the opening scene involves chong on her spaceship communicating with her superior someone who we do not see but that chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light they use no spoken words but telepathy so we are treated to subtitles trouble is both chong and her superiors subtitles both look alike and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually speaking at any given moment which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish the spaceship is the worst effect to come out of hollywood this side of an ed wood film now i am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this but these effects really got to me the most offensive was the most simple one a fake night sky the stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone most notably are the moments where chong tells someone she comes from pleiades and we get a shot of the seven stars thing is the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie but any stargazer knows that pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations perseus and taurus and the cluster doesnt take up much room in the sky at all these effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment be careful for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have willie nelson turn into a human spotlight and oh it has to be seen to be believedstarlight star bright last star i see tonight i wish i might i wish i may not have to watch any more of this trash todayzantaras score out of,neutral
728,i finally caught up to starlight last night on television and all i can say is wow its hard to know where to begin the incredibly hokey special effects check out the laser beams shooting out of willies eyes the atrocious acting the ponderous dialogue the mismatched use of stock footage or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production this truly is a oneofakind experience and we should all be thankful for that i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood,neutral
729,this has an interesting albeit somewhat fanciful scifi plot but its wasted with poor direction and shlocky special effects rae dawn chong is appealing despite the lack of a believable story and direction consistent with her talent,positive
730,all i can really say is that im glad that i was knitting socks while watching the movie or i would be very angry for having wasted hours of my life the acting was terrible the plot was even worse there were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and i laughing out loud i highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of mstk,neutral
731,i shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing preachy cinematic trash larded with enough indianwannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a newage shop starlight makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a featherwearing crystalfondling idiotthe plot alien rae dawn chong arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert earths impending environmental collapse but first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a refugee from a castro street bar fortunately theyve got mystical grandpa willie nelson along to help who looks faintly embarrassed by the proceedings as well he ought to be along with buckets of cheap fx and reams of pointlessly swelling musicsure the clunky script helps to obscure the films trite plot and staggering pace but thats just the tip of this melting movie iceberg everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science,neutral
732,i wanted to see it because of two reasons one it was the remake of high sierra with bogart two the bogart part was played by jack palance whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility as in the big knifebut now i wonder why they decided to shoot this remake the film follows the same plot as hig sierra only here the actors dont care the director is lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer was thinking jack palance is getting bored looking at shelley winters and shelley winters is asking herself what shes doing in this film i dont even want to compare her to ida lupino in the same role and of course they had to use the dog story again they surely could have come up with some different ideas perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot high sierra but that definitely doesnt add any quality to the filmits a waste of time if youve seen high sierra before otherwise why not see a pseudofilm noir as for me id rather die than see it one more time,neutral

734,i have been known to fall asleep during films but this is usually due to a combination of things including really tired being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot however on this occasion i fell asleep because the film was rubbish the plot development was constant constantly slow and boring things seemed to happen but with no explanation of what was causing them or why i admit i may have missed part of the film but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else i cant recommend this film at all,neutral
735,let me count the ways a titleonly remake that pulls out every clich in the slasher handbook a plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic a completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills a pg rating that insures no gore violence or sex a villain that is not frightening or even mysterious a cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldnt possibly care about them a lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere much unlike the original prom night a script of dialog thats beyond poor its mind numbing a series of cardboard performances not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that a completely inept teentargeted slasher remake thats not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination or even to show a puddle of bloodits a nobrainer horror fans save your moneybomb out of,negative
736,prom night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a lifetime original film you know the one this october lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving insert disease name here to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker exboyfriend its dramatic its sappy its immensely dull it does nothing to further a genre tell an original story or strive for any sort of newness prom night shares this plight watching the killer poke holes in his victims we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled it occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie historyour director is working with a fairly goodlooking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier think about matthew mcconaughey coming at you with a knife youd probably go oh good lookin guy is going to kill me naaaa not scary even for a second so the director throws schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror this mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator youll get jump scares in this film of which made my date jump i might mention she is afraid of everything id also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave meas if this film were not disjointed enough it appears to be cut to shreds im not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film im saying as the film moves from scene to scene you often get a jarring jump this is the kind of thing youd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together cross his fingers and hope for the best the editor should be shotwith a plot you can pack into two sentences one stray spray of blood an emo killer and the tension of a very special episode of silver spoons were left with no reason to support horror this weekend at least on the big screen in fact this is the sort of film that should be punished is it really that hard to make a scary movie was this crew even aware they were making a horror film a complete waste of my time and yours i bit the bullet to get you this review dont let my sacrifice be in vain dont go into the movie,neutral
737,poor acting no script no plot no convincing killer no suspense no original setups it uses the same closetunder the bedpersonbehindyouinthemirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring and not in a foreshadowing way either and the fact that nobody ever really gets killed at least not on screen which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve more cheated for spending money on their admission ticketits a horror film wo any horror lmao the most you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheetyou have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this or you were highdrunk at the timehonestly i have a life and dont bother writing reviews that often unless i really really hated something or enjoyed it tremendouslybut this film is awful and i feel i have a duty of sorts to warn you not to give your money to hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again it is one thing to rent a bad movie at blockbuster from the weinsteins its another when you have to sit through it in a theateralso in case you want some remake nostalgia forget it this is not a remake nor is it a reimagining it is not scary nor engaging nor is it satisfying enough to be funny like others on imdb have claimedit is just stale and booooringhere is what you will take away from this film remembering the scar on brittany snows head that stands out more than the plot the fact that jonathan schaech must be having some sexual affair with js cardone of the forsaken to have gotten another role as a killerbecause he is as frightening as my poodle and too cute to kill just about anyone and that for some reason duh everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back what kind of person would not get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow doesnt show up this is my warning to you do not waste youre money like i did the original sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for jamie lee curtis fans though no way near as bad as this piece of crap sorry to sound vulgar or rude but once you see this you will understand why i say what i say,neutral

739,i am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself but i just got back from this movie and felt i had to express my opinions let me start by saying that i am a huge horror fan but what makes a horror movie i sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development i know they often lack in horror movies but prom night looked like it didnt even put forth any effort in that department next we all love suspense that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises yeah prom night had none of that of course we like a terrifying killer prom night have that nope it has a pretty boy with a cute lil knife and when all else failsat least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore and the occasional nude scene yeah well when you have a horror movie rated pg like prom night they leave that stuff out too so with all of these elements missing i askdoes this still count as a horror movie nope id call it more of a comedy people in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when i saw semipro that was supposed to actually be a comedy which also sucked but thats another story i think i am just going to have to give up on new horror all the good horror movies of the good ol days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money the people i went to see it with didnt even know this was a remake which made me mad i wonder what will happen when theres no more movies to remake where will horror go next,neutral
740,so prom night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie im a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning but upon seeing it it is neither horror or thrilleri was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable you could predict what was going to happen next the young actors were alright at playing their characters but id have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game acting wiseyes ill give props for the plot because it was good but its not thrilling or scary there were almost zero jumpinyourseat scenes so dont waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres wait til it comes to dvd,neutral
741,when i first saw the trailer for prom night i have to admit the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie so my friend and i saw prom night last night and i have to say i must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film not to mention i am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people there was no tension the characters how was i supposed to care about them they had no development whatsoever the killer oh my god this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed i know its a film but why would a man who neveror at least we know of killed any one before kill a girls family and friends that hes just obsessed over i mean was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her i have no idea because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horrordonnas family was just brutally murdered by her teacher who has become very obsessed over her he was captured and put in jail its been years and shes just now getting some peace in her life shes even going to her senior prom but the killer has escaped and still has donna on his mind he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends and the hotel maid and the bell boy because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employees are donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses unnoticed and can kill people so silently just wowim sorry i really did want to love this movie we havent had a good slasher flick in a long time but this was just a stupid movie that i was not impressed with just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious i know that this was a pg movie but i just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes not to mention no stab holes i wouldnt recommend this movie for anyone unless youre a teen this movie was made for the teenagers not adults and not for those who know a real horror movie no offense to those who did enjoy this film but i dont understand how anyone could,negative
742,i saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that my girl friend turned to me and said we have to go see this movieenough said so i saw this about minutes go and i tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there werent even any of those it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall i would love to see the script as the first mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music there was absolutely no character developmentthe plot is justwell there was no plot it was basically i know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer thats brilliant hmmm the acting was what you expect in a australian soap opera hopeless that main character the blondie god dam she annoyed me her longest line must have been half a sentence and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expressionplease listen to me if you have any taste in movies dont go see this and if your like me and dont have a choice well then i wish you good luck maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine cant believe this film got made,neutral

744,im not particularly fond of remakes or to steal the modern jargon retellings but this film truly peeved me off the original prom night while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece still realized what it was horror there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience sorry folks but a white knuckle film this was not the scares were cheap and foreshadowed terribly a good example of scare which has been done to clichd excess now is the cat jumping out of the closet followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film this film couldnt successfully pull that off so how could i expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film there needs to be a likable hero or heroine this film doesnt have one the person i most identified with was the head detective his calm demeanor but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have common sense approach to events that occur if youre running from an axe wielding psycho you turn and sprint in the opposite direction not jog whilst looking back ever three seconds gaging the killers progress only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path if you friend disappears you dont go looking for them alone and if you suspect foul play you tell someone not investigate yourself these clichs are tired and well overplayed in the horror genre in general and in this film in particular,positive
745,imagine the scenario you are at the movie theater only because you are in washington for the weekend and its raining and youre finished with the museums you think you might go see the sarah marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you dont have to engage your brain its sold out options the bank job in bruges the leatherheads or prom night youve seen the bank job suprisingly decent heist movie that and in bruges again pretty good so youre down to two you dont fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in football uniforms so you go see prom night right wrong you take the walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for it would be money better spentit actually plays like more of a comedy than a horrorthriller or whatever it is supposed to be if i was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut i wouldnt know whether to laugh or cry probably both an insult to anyones intelligence my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie as for the acting they might as well have cast robots or maybe dogs in the roles they would have been more realistic the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen ben affleck and hayden christansan i hate his acting so much i dont care how you spell his name you are relieved on your titles so in summary not good,neutral
746,and rent a good horror movie its like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didnt realize every single thing he wrote was clichd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like scream and scary moviein between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written stupid were going to the prom junk i wanted to claw my ears off honestly the hills has better dialogthere really was no need to make this movie leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking her really guy is obsessed with her really all the characters act in stupid ways including the police cover the place in teams of front and back not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem no resistance from victims or doors nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door the people are like mentally disabled sheepby the by if youre a gore fan youll be disappointed too all the killing is kept offscreen and is ahem tastefully done so boo hoo for you none of the killings is the least bit interesting most of the time theyve already happened by the time we find outthe only clich missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies oh kitty you scared me i thought you were the killer aiieeee and then at the end when its time for the killer to die well lets just say its the easiest and most obvious choice snorethe audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough dont encourage this kind of lazy filmmakingoh and by the way no crowning of a prom king or queen no tiara no bucket of blood so save your money and rent carrie or friday the th or halloween or scream or scary movie any of them to get a good scare with some original twists,neutral
747,okay so i just got back before i start my review let me tell you one thing i wanted to like this movie i know ive been negative in the past but i was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film i didntits not just the fact that every horror clich imaginable is in this and its not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare walking into a baseball bat left on the floor are you kidding me it just wasnt scary one thing i was surprised about there was more blood than i thought there was going to be which isnt saying muchthe film starts off with donna being dropped off by lisas mom at her house she comes in goes upstairs camera pans to her father dead on the couch spooky she goes upstairs where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens finds her brother on his bed apparently dead how could she tell he didnt have a spot of blood on him killer comes in donna hides under bed mom dies she runs outside screaming for help killer behind her i did it for us cut to therapy session this confused a lot of people everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back filler dialogue ensuesthey cut to the chase pretty quick few scenes at the salon they go to the hotel of course the killer is already there for some reason he escaped days ago but the policefamily werent informed until hes already there more filler ensuesim not going to go on about what happens in the film because i dont want to spoil it too much if you want to know who dies horrorfan made a post about it already but on the subjects of deaths they werent that exciting people in the theatre actually laughed out loud an experience ive never had before in a horror movie not even in when a stranger calls during several of them one in particular the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious scared face ive ever seen the only death involving any blood was lisas and that was pretty scarce her throat is slashed blood if you can even call it that it was practically black splatters on the curtainthing the only other blood was on claire when we see her body apparently fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death um okay the movie was one of the most clichd ive ever seen lets see here obligatory closemirrorcurtainboom scene check twice actually you could tell they were struggling mandatory backingupintokiller check theres also the backingupintolamp scene but youve all seen that oh you say you want a birdsflyingaway scare well you got it yes they managed to incorporate one of those in here and of course the wehavesecurityonallexitsbuthestillescaped scene shall i go on i couldfor anyone saying the characters werent stupid are you kidding me oh even though the massive alarm is ringing literally saying please vacate the building and of my friends are missing im going to go upstairs to get my wrap these characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever the only likable character lisa made one of the most stupid moves in the movie oh i just realized the psychoteacher is here i must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her oh shoot the elevator is being to slow guess ill take the stairs and run off into the construction site ugh by the end of the film they all deserved to die the only death anyone felt any remorse for was donnas boyfriend i cant even remember his name is that bad and by that time the audience was completely drained out of this scareless clichd filmthere were some positives the acting was decent for the most part and it was wellshot but thats about itid give it a and thats being generous just for the laughs and believe me the audience had a few and brittany snowoh and the reaction was bad very bad people were booing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative expect bad legs for this one,neutral
748,good grief i cant even begin to describe how poor this film is dont get me wrong i wasnt expecting much to begin with lets face it a pg slasher flick is predestined to be missing the ummm slashing so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore but it was the level of incompetence and clich on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy and heres a turnup for the books she never changes hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing character development if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again on top of this were handed possibly the least intriguing and definitely the least scary killer ever to grace the genre im not joking when i say that dora the explorer has scarier villains than this moviefinally because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept and apparently thirteenyearold director what could possibly be left to fill up hours of screen time closets thats what lots and lots of closets big closets small closets mirrored closets closets to narnia so many damned closets youll not want to dress yourself for another year in fact this movie should have just been called closet and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert something to the extent of what the f did we just waste our time watching,negative
749,this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business the idea that audiences paid to see this movie and like an idiot i rented the film is discouraging alsoobsessed teacher years prior kills teenagers family because he wants her for no reason he kills the mother father and brother from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction years later obsessed teacher breaks out of prison hmmusual bad writingno one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around sniff out people and with a knife is super killer sure now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason knifes bellhop for the fun of it and starts to hunt down the teenagers friends now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotelagain it is stupid ever cop would know his facebut he walks right by them now he kills two cops outside teenagers house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriendthere is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage if any other profession put out work of this low quality they would be fired yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash,neutral
750,i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten before going to this movie the day after it came out i came on imdb to check out the comments a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog i never go by other peoples opinions so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie it had to be one of the worst movies ive ever seenthe person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff since when do scary movies have sappy scenes i swear im amazed there werent any group hug momentsi think i jumped once and thats because i zoned out thinking about my research paper for english the clichd birdscat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happenand the characters were stupid my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said i have to get my moms shawl you idiot screw the shawl safety is just a few steps away but no my moms shawl that didnt match the dress by the way is wayyyy more important than my health and safety and to top it all off they take her back to her house knowing that the killer knew where she lived godmy friend and i also predicted the entire movie and not just the i bet hes hiding under the bed moments it was the he stole the bellhops clothes and sneaked out of the hotel and its the detective coming down the hallway not the killer moments movies should never be this predictable disney movies arent even this predictableim gonna complete my rant now by saying this was a terrible movie im glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldnt buy it for and then hate it it was just bad it wouldve been better if only one thing wouldve happened if after being shot by the detective the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in knife in hand falling and stabbing the girl on his way down oh how lovely that wouldve beendont waste your time or money go see a good movie,negative
751,prom night directed by nelson mccormickstarring brittany snow scott porter jessica stroup and dana davisplot three years ago donna brittany snow witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher jonathan schaech who has a bit of a crush on her now she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends once there they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt pros i got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character movesan exampleeveryone decides not to tell donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her she doesnt seem that great has escaped from prison their reason they dont want to embarrass her in front of all her friends lolcons let me start off by saying im a huge slasher fan usually i can have fun with even the bad ones i even like some pg horror films tourist trap one of my favorites was originally rated pg i also enjoy poltergeist and the grudge so the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated pg does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the moviefirst of all i had a big problem with the story i like slasher films that dont even have stories at least they can be entertaining this is about a teacher who falls in love with his student so he kills her entire family a few years later he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends then there were subplots that i doubt anyone cared about claire jessica stroup is fighting with her boyfriend she has cramps and i couldnt care less this should have been a lifetime feature not a remake of prom night and then this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes i dont even care that its not that gory some of my favorite slashers halloween curtains the original prom night were not that gory but they still had effective murders here we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds and a closeup on a bad actors face as he screams in agony im sure that yearold girls were terrified but not mei also hated the characters there was donnas unrealistically sensitive boyfriend bobby scott porter and i can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life unless you are a gay male then we had donnas annoying friends claire stroup and lisa dana davis and the token mean girl chrissy brianne davis if you thought the characters in death proof were annoying try watching this movie and dont get me started on ronnie collins pennie and the dj jay phillips who gave me flashbacks to ushers performance in shes all thatadd to all that predictable plot turns a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material and you have quite a stinker,negative
752,note i couldnt force myself to actually write up a constructive review of prom night it just cant be done instead i went through what i thought about while watching the moviethings that i thought about while watching prom night im so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it of course when i say elaborate deaths i mean off screen throat slashes or stabs in the stomach didnt the whole its just a dream thing get ruined by dallas speaking of which i wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate deaththe film is only ten minutes into and i can already count the horror clichs on two hands not a good signeven after just meeting the protagonists boyfriend im convinced he will die anybody want to place bets the killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character donna by the way does anybody think that donna is a horrible name for a main character in a horror film he spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds donna celebrating her high school prom while there is no accounting for taste i seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as donnahigh schools allow proms to take place at hotels and doesnt keep track of the students apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please i suppose if this plot point wasnt in place the movie would be minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom i suppose the tradeoff for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything ive already played count the pieces of chewed bubble gum under the seat and guess how much money i have in my wallet and im only in the minute mark how else will i entertain myself note to self dont forget milk and bread on the way homedear screenwriter youve used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this yearthe version of this film wasnt that good but compared to this remake it was like citizen kane or at least the godfather it had jamie lee curtis in one of her many posthalloween horror flicks and it did have a little twist at the end i miss jamie lee i wish shed act moreapparently at prom there isnt much dancing going on instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college i hear all these colleges being brought up by name and i cant help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off of on the entrance exam to get inthe killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up his mess between scenes thats the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room there is no trace of a struggle on another side note this is a very lazy killer michael myers went hunting after his victims just sayingits official the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer what triggered it was it whenever donna went back up to her hotel room while sirens were going off ordering everybody to exit the building was it her constant dreams and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee or was it brittany snows unconvincing performance ill have to say it was all of the aboveokay who had he dies off screen in the third act you win the potfinally the movie is over my friend turns to me and says donna wasnt too smart thats the understatement of the week kind of like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind or a week long power outage is a slight inconveniencei cant wait to get on rotten tomatoes and see if anybody gave this move a favoring reviewi cant recommend this i refuse to recommend this this is as lazy of a horror film as any and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers and unfortunately for theater patrons alcohol isnt servedrating out of,neutral
753,i went into this with my hopes up by twenty minutes into the movie i couldnt have been more let down despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake i kept my hopes high that maybejust maybe someone would get it right this time around sadly prom night is about on the same quality level as the recent april fools day remake bad script bad direction cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horrorfrom beginning to end its boring repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls weve seen it all before and weve seen it done a million times better then this if you go to see prom night in the theater id say wait for the dvd or ppv get ready for the audience to laugh because laugh they will the laughs arent at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny they are in response to key thrilling moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of scary movie seriously was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof the film makers missed the mark so badly here that a large number of the audience in the theater i attended walked out about halfway through the movie which in retrospect i wish i had done not me though i had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better needless to say it didnt the horror scenes are a joke not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction the script the special effects and the camera work the movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it but still came out of it with a micro budget movie i halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking i would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere this movies scary alright if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed,negative
754,prom night is a titleonly remake of the slasher flick that starred jamie lee curtis and leslie nielsen this movie takes place in an oregon town where donna brittany snow is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years she and her friends arrive at the prom which is taking place in a grand hotel and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives little does anyone know a man from donnas past who has haunted her for years is also at the prom and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of herim a fan of the original prom night so i tried to maintain a little hope in this movie but i have to admit i was quite disappointed prom night suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have and that is predictability there are absolutely no surprises here and i felt i had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times often better before what does this equate to for the audience boredom unless of course you have never seen any horror movies or are part of the preteen crowd but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen the plot is simplistic but the entire script is void of any type of surprise twist atmosphere or anything and this really really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into it all just seemed very blanda lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a pg slasher movie as well and i understand what they are saying but i dont think its impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore take carpenters halloween for example little to no on screen violence but still an extremely frightening and effective movie you dont need gore to make a film scary but even had prom night been gratuitously violent which it is not it is very tame it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with the tension and suspense here is mild at best and i spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations and was correct about of the time our characters arent well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them and their bythenumbers demises are routine and carelessi will point out a few things i did like about this movie though because it wasnt completely useless the cinematography is really nice and everything was very wellfilmed and fairly stylish among the jump scares that are for the most part very predictable there were a few that were kind of clever the sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold however predictable the unfolding may be as for the acting its mediocre at best brittany snow plays the lead decently but really the rest of the cast doesnt show off much talent johnathan schaech plays the villain and is probably the most experienced performer here but even he isnt that impressive however i did like the character he played which was a nice change from the typical maskedstalker type killer we see a lot as far as the ending goes the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wits end and it was very anticlimacticoverall prom night was a disappointment everything was very bythenumbers routine and predictable which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie there were a few neat moments but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere and had little plot development nor believable characters id advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till its out on video or rent the original instead because there are absolutely no surprises here some may find a little entertainment in it but it was far too predictable for my tastes i expected better and left the theater very disappointed,neutral
755,if i could give this film a real rating it would likely be in the minus numbers while i respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible horror films seriously people buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your timedespite it being a horror film there is nothing scary about it unless the idea of seeing how many horror clichs you can fit in one movie scares you if the rating had been higher it probably would have made for a better film in the long runwhoever made this version of prom night you screwed up the actors could probably have done a decent job if it werent for the questionable scripting this was a terrible waste of a cinema trip id sooner go and see one missed call again at least that had some plot,neutral
756,i think it was an overrated pg crap at least brittany snows performance was good and some others like idris elba were good too but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing the killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too the deaths were stupid boring and completely unoriginals the movie was very boring too and very overrated it wasnt suspenseful at all i almost fall asleep its another bad pg remake its really a dreadful movie imo the ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring the movie is pretty slow too overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe brittany snow i think she gave a good performance and idris elba too but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake well thats just my opinion i gave it a,negative
757,i saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts i must admit i found it pretty decentuntil i started to think about what the characters were saying logical problems her boyfriend who seems to be a pretty fit dude makes no sound while being killed dont you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer when the remark is made that the gym teacher is soooo in love with lisa i almost screamed at the screen when your best friends family has been killed by a teacher who was in love with her you dont make comments like that if you have half of a heart as soon as nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead wouldnt the smart thing to do be to get donna boyfriend aunt and uncle into a car and drive far far away then bait the house with the hrt and police force so that the killer has no way to get outi could go on and on and on basically the plot was decent the characters werent profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errorshoweverthis movie might be good for teenagers or young couples just looking for a fun night out if you dont consider all the goofs its a mediocre film,positive
758,why hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime the texas chainsaw massacre the hills have eyes but is it considerably worse why hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that werent brilliant to start with prom night the amityville horror much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere character or any genuine scares at all prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch but for all the wrong reasonsits a poorly acted massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do its clear hollywood horror is dead even the likes of the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot prom night is virtually bloodless and im not even going to mention how bad the plot is its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm the originalone of the most notorious slasher films of the s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be donna keppel brittany snow has survived a terrible tragedy but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in stylewhen the big night finally arrives donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big highschool blowout by living it up and partying till dawn but while donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance an obsessed killer is on the loose and hell slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only donnawho will survive to see graduation day and what will donna do when shes forced to confront her greatest fear scott porter jessica stroup and dana davis costar in the slasher remake that will have tuxedoclad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor a plot that will probably put you off going to see this witch if you ask me is a good thingwithout much to work with mccormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations at one point a girl backs into a floor lamp a lamp and mccormick tries to pump it up into a jumpscare moment desperate times really do call for desperate measures there havent been this many shots of closets since the last ikea cataloguein the era of the hills my super sweet and to catch a predator there probably is a freaky scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and societys creepy obsession with youthful beauty this is not that moviemy final verdict avoid at all cost nobody will like prom night its even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hackjob remakes considering its absolute lack of blood or frights a night youll be in a hurry to forget,neutral
759,ok this movie was made for one reason and one reason only to make moneythe producers obviously didnt care about killing a classic horror movie i knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg how many pg slashers movies have turned out to be good thats like asking how many women have been on the moon the answer is none prom night was of cource no masterpiece but it certainly deserves to be recognised as a movie that stays true to its genre and deosnt try to be anything more than thatmy problem with prom night is the way that it handles the killer and i have major problems with himthe way he escapes he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through a air conditioning vent what the hell why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something his intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her so does he want to kill her love her or just plain rape her the killer is too good how did he develop all of his skills he used to be a teacher so in this one scene where he kills the main victims boyfriend while hes basically on top of her asleep and she doesnt notice it all silly stars out of terriblesillystupid attempt at a horror movie,positive
760,the night of the prom the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic and so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some headpeckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule livesthere really is no excuse for prom night there is less than nothing original about it and i truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on imdb the only part of my viewing that i enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of ghosts it was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of themthe plot was basically some guy going on a rampage and the thing was it wasnt even a slightly exciting rampage maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame robbie williams lookalike with a baseball cap i might have sat there feeling slightly anxious the fact that i cared less about the characters than i did about the colour of the cinema carpet didnt really add to the effect either and to make matters worse the rest of the characters were equally onedimensional and oblivious the hotel staff didnt seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave i was incredibly surprised that the bitchy stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was she realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets nice onethe worst thing was i hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest he really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening shocking and the music dont even get me started it was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funerali really wish that prom night was a joke it was terrible and stupidly predictable no one in their right mind or otherwise has any reason to see this film mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation if you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film hear my plea dont do it there are better things to spend six pounds on like a sheet to play ghosts with,neutral
761,the acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay it was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes the ending was even worse everyone kept dying but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly ok they did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had etc the movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline the only reason i give this is that i kind of feel bad for the young actors they needed better coaching they could have really made this an ok film but the screenplay and acting failed miserably,neutral

763,when i first saw the preview for this movie i really couldnt wait to see it the plot seemed good and the setting was great i mean a slasher movie that takes place on prom night great idea and the plot a high school teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students goes crazy gets arrested and escapes three years later on prom night prom night a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable turns into hell however i saw it and was extremely disappointed it was not only the worst horror movie i have ever seen but it was one of the worst movie in general that i have ever seen first of all it wasnt even scary there was not one moment in that movie when i jumped out of my seat also the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull all the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats also there was absolutely no gore its rated pg the scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl he slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them they dont actually show him cutting her throatnext you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie he isnt mysterious creepy or scary hes just this guy who kills peoplealso everything in the movie was so clich an example is when at the end the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment the detective shoots and kills him also every single thing in this movie was so predictable the victim after seeing the guy with a knife runs for her life hides thinks she gets away and then the killer just pops out and kills herfinally the sequence of the movie was extremely bad the guy goes into the hotel kills a few people the bodies are discovered someone pulls the fire alarm and everyone evacuates the main character forgets something in her room has an encounter with the killer runs and escapes thats it she and her boyfriend go home the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house finds the girl then gets killed by the detective the movie sequence was so stupid and clichif your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good trust me dont waste your time or money no wonder this movie was being shown in the smallest theater in the movie theater my friend and i along with these two girls sitting in the back were the only ones in the theater that should have told me something about the movie beforehand,neutral
764,we have all been asking ourselves why dont they remake the slasher films that were only ok instead of remaking the ones that were great already that way they can only make it better well with prom night they have remade the average but trashy fun s jamie lee curtis film and made it even worse its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens hence no violence etc the knife in this slasher flick is bluntthe director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the windowthe cast who include britney snow who was superb in hairspray try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scaredmore annoying is how the death scenes are handled we will hear the attack but wont see it it also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids yet in pours the money from americans sending this film to number at the box office slasher movies are a lot of fun but in prom nights case it made me want to download the originalive seen scarier oc and dawsons creek episodes,neutral

767,in my knowledge largo winch was a famous belgium comics never read telling the adventures of a playboy a sort of james bond without the spy life so when i had to choose a movie for a yearsold kid i picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of james bondbut just after the opening credits i got heavy doubts when american movies offer amazing start here no action and a torrid sex scene then the story get very complicated with financial moves i thought i lost the kidbut strangely he had been caught by largo and more than james bond was it the excellent interpretation of tomer sisley the difficult relationship largo has with his father the multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys the bad guys are the friends the exotic locations of honkkong yougoslavia dunno but he really cares about largo will he get up and we enjoyed our moment,neutral

769,but cinderella gets my vote not only for the worst of disneys princess movies but for the worst movie the company made during walts lifetime the music is genuinely pretty and the story deserves to be called classic what fails in this movie are the characters particularly the title character who could only be called the heroine in the loosest sense of the termafter a brief prologue the audience is introduced to cinderella she is waking up in the morning and singing a dream is a wish your heart makes this establishes her as an idealist and thus deserving of our sympathy unfortunately the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about freedom from her servant role the respect of her stepfamily someone to talk to besides mice and birds in one song cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest dvd cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently you go girlfriend in short cinderella is a very bland character she passively accepts her stepfamilys abuse escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief she only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family for this she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except of course cinderella can anyone see belle or jasmine being such a doormat if cinderella is dull her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless the prince in cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time we are given no indication if he is a good man if he respects cinderella or anything all we know is he is a prince and he dances well heck even the prince from snow white got to sing a romantic song at least not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting it makes cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot weakening her already tenuous appealperhaps realizing how dull the main characters were the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movies comic relief cinderellas friends the mice granted these characters are amusing even so when the comic relief steals the show from the principals well lets just say your story has some problemsdinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as masterpieces while many of them are there are some that do not deserve this appellate in any way cinderella is a prime example of this fact,neutral
770,just saw it yesterday in the sao paulo intl film festival just before going i came here to see how it was rated and at that time it was a pretty nice rateafter minutes i was dying to get out never did this but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screeningi did not like at all the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere the characters are shallower than the dialogs nothing lead anywhere and the worst and worst plenty of siemens and organics advertising on the movie despite the fact that i already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself i still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and siemens mobile poppingup all the time on her laptop or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen all of this would be bearable if the plot characters romances anything was good but was bad really bad a dont know how to do sexinthecitydont waste your time or money,negative
771,when i bought this dvd i though it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in portuguese standards lets give it a chance i was totally wrong what a disappointing movie first its not a comedy its a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that its even worse than many portuguese soap operas second the plot is so boring and leads nowhere it has no structure it just flows like the wind in one or another direction the production is also bad the sound mixing is horrible because sometimes the voices are disconnected it made me remind some old portuguese movies from the s the acting should have been better too well to sum up its not with films like this one that portuguese cinema will improve in fact it was one of the worst portuguese movies i have seen in the last years bad argument bad acting bad production i had no high hopes for this movie but it was much worse than ive ever imagined just forget about it,negative
772,ill indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin my dissatisfaction is split tonedeafness lackluster writingthe i agree with the first commenters synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories i was surprised how this film at best woefully shortchanges the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if its inhabited only by the cast of gossip girl this is coming from someone who likes gossip girl a few minority characters are written into the stories but they are included by obligation while we can see the gears under the film so clearly striving to be diverse but falling eversoshortthe is why everything falls short all characters white plus a few token minorities are onedimensional cardboard cutouts of people concepts worse their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what id say is a gag we get a basic conceit then some punchline intended to be a clever twist but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say okay that was a surprisethe stories are still not that interesting because they too are shallow when you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending youre writing jokesspoilers belowthe movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories thats fine but romance is amazing deep sometimes complex these romantic stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other words exchange thoughts are projected through voiceover but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to anothermeaning there is no seduction in the broad sense no tension and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other the only story involving a superficial seduction is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy ethan hawke gets outwitted by the girl hes hitting on who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker sure his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as wed be if we were next to them but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of a then b so it unfolds if something like a postcard could unfold with all the other tales as well a then bthats it the only point being that these happen to occur on set in manhattan by the way the only brooklyn we see is the coney island sketch the only queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west villageits easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race gender sexual orientation and so on new york i love you however deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title we expect to see the real new york and real new yorkers but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic its characters flown in from the oc plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity but when we look closer at who those characters are the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to representfor example the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny male nanny when in fact hes the father notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramaticconstruction point of view it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriendstepfather are strutting the girl away it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girls father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer what the dad cant be just some guy from south america now that hes obviously hot is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middletoupperclass white woman are we that naive as to require such as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatableits not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone but in every conceivable setup and plot twist the direction taken screams status quo appeals to safety all these stories could have been made more interesting even if we were forced to keep the singledimensionality of the characters inhabiting them at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes asian girl living in chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy how bout an asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead again im not saying the entire conceit has to be changed its just that every damn story premise is so hackneyedand thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york outside the trite the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth readingi will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack the good pacing of the movie even if what was being paced was well dredge and the general feel of many of the scenes the movie was just fine to sit through and i wouldnt dissuade anyone from doing so however it is telling that the most significant homage paid to nonsuperficiality is when the old opera singer says paraphrased thats what i love about new york everyones from a different place well you wouldnt know it from watching this one,neutral
773,having loved paris je taime i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasonsalthough i was not expecting a remake of paris in new york i was expecting the same structure what i liked about paris was the breakup of the neighborhoods you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell in ny there is no clear separation of the stories at different points in the film characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on also the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flowanother thing i loved about the paris film was the different takes on love it wasnt all romantic there was love between parents and their children unrequited love a lonely middleaged woman yearning for love etc it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans ny seemed to only go for an edgy overthetop sexuality there were some redeemable shorts the older couple having spent a lifetime together julie christies short but overall theny film didnt evoke any emotion for me i didnt connect with any of the characters like i did with paris i remember watching paris and feeling a deep sadness loneliness yearning hopefulness wonder it just had so much soul for me there was no soul in the ny filmmaybe if i had gone into it without having paris looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response but as a selftitled retake of paris je taime i was sorely disappointed,positive
774,i saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight at a preview screening and i was straight up blown away by how bad it was first off the film practically flaunted its gaping blind spots there are no black or gay new yorkers in love or who say know the selfinvolved white people in love i know its not the love crash of anviltastic inclusiveness but you cant pretend to have a cinematic new york with out these fairly prevalent members of society plus you know the people who produced this ish thought crash deserved that hamhanded oscar so where is everyone possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs me either this movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst bad acting bad writing bad directing all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants but thank god they finally got powerhouses hayden christensen and rachel bilson back together for that jumper reunion and side note uma dodged a bullet ethan hawke looks ravaged this of course is one thing in terms of his looks but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor lovely maggie qi had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire but it has to be the anton yelchin olivia thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste which saddens me because i really like those two actors i dont consider myself easily offended but all i could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someones year old aunt a close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is shia labeoufs tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former disney channel star to act against julie christie i dont mean opposite i mean against against is the only explanation i realize now that the early sequence with orlando bloom is a relative highlight highlight please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits which seem to be a nod to the first new york real world this film is embarrassing strangely dated inarticulate ineffective pretentious and in the end completely divorced from any real idea of new york at all the extra star is for the cloris leachman eli wallach sequence as it is actually quite sweet but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of pointless masturbatory torment,neutral
775,ive never been to paris but after seeing paris je taime im crazy to visit this city ive been to ny several times and i love the city and its boroughs i kinda expected to be touched by this film to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away but lo and behold i regret the time and money i spent with it there are no love stories between people or a person and the city theres a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesnt work out fine maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city where its said to have thousands of people living on their own cant you find love in new york,positive
776,this was a movie i could not wait to see so i finally got it and i was pretty disappointed for startersthe movie has so little said about new yorkjust a bunch of confusing shots of buildingsstreetsbridges and cafesit really doesnt stay focused on the new york magicanother thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this moviei know that it is a remakebut it is not a french style remake anywayhere you will notice elements that remind you of french moviessuch as long and messy scenesno or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style the story follows many lives too many for my taste and they somehow seem connected in the end i feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories the movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyones happy endingso we can see about people for about minutes eachand there you have your minutes if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you i give it just because i love new york and i loved the cast,neutral
777,following the success of paris je taime a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york unlike the original film the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quicklyby the time you think are getting into a story its over in too many cases and the often start up and stop and then begin againwith the stories woven together as a result there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structuresadly however while paris je taime was hit or miss mostly hit most of new york i love you was miss the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweetand often quite terrible it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional storiesand perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so now understand it was good quality music but its somber tone really really made me feel like cutting my wrists among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant though this was also in the first film and the crotchety old couple this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so muchand i really wanted to love this film i respected what they tried but simply didnt like it very muchby the way and this is not really a complaint but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film for a recent film that was unusual in our more antismoking culturealso if you get the dvd there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film one consists of kevin bacon wearing a cool fedora eating a hotdogand absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the worldincluding a very unhappy couple,positive
778,a few years back the same persons who created parisjtaime which was imperfect but very enjoyable my rating was a created this piece of garbage about new york cityin paris i love you jtaimecreated a feeling for paris it was made in many parts of beautiful parisin this current film i did not recognize new york city i did not feel that i was in the city of my birthnew york does have boroughsi saw no scenes in the bronx or queens there is one scene in brooklynbrighton beach i saw no scenes in times square or greenwich village no scenes of the beautiful hotels or theatres it does have a large castmost of the performers were not even stereotypes they were caricatures of the lowest sortthe very few humorous moments are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine new yorkers that we all know love a few of the films nominated for the razzie awards were far betterratings out of points out of imdb out of in my way of thinking i think the title should have beennew york i hate you,positive
779,an anthology is always risky business and i think this endeavor should be praised theres a lot of talent involved here a great many talented actors directors and writers unfortunately i couldnt really enjoy this movie based on three issues i hadfirst of all the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality and unfortunately some of them clash with the others secondly several segments feel underdeveloped to me like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition im not talking about happy endings here or even an ending period but rather they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in last but not least i did not feel newyork and its inhabitants were properly portrayedwhat youre left with is highbrow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied,positive
780,new york i love you or rather shouldbetitled manhattan i love looking at your people in sometimes love is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation case in point look at two of the segments in the film one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexytalk and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books while the latter isnt a great story by any stretch its at least something that has a beginning middle and end as the composer tries to score gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap and in the end gets some help and maybe something more from a girl hes been talking to as a liaison between him and the director the ethan hawke scene however is like nothing and feels like it like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in or for that matter hawke with a combo of before sunrise and reality biteswhats irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible stories and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another ie bits involving bradley cooper drea dematteo hayden christensen andy garcia james caan natalie portman etc its not even so much that the film set practically always in manhattan and not the new york of queens or staten island or the bronx not even say harlem or washington heights lacks a good deal of diversity since there is some its the lack of imagination that one found in spades for better or worse in paris jtaime its mostly got little to do with new york except for passing references and at its worst the julie christieshia labeouf segment its incomprehensible on a level that is appallingso basically wait for tv and do your best to dip in and out of the film in that is for three scenes the aforementioned bloomchristina ricci segment which is charming the brett ratner directed segment yes xmen brett ratner with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their th wedding anniversary everything else can be missed even natalie portmans directorial debut and the return of a hughes brother only one allan to the screen a mixed bag is putting it lightly its like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left,positive
781,the problems with this film are many but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones first of all while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life the reality was that everything as usual in movies and tv was about something bizarre usually of a sexual nature the story lines were thin or nonexistent and virtually every scene camera shot line of dialog and expressed emotion was absolutely and totally fake it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out something no uncommon for me in recent years i would have guessed the film was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some rd rate film studies program but i believe the at one time preamelia talenteddirector mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool,neutral
782,there is a reason this went straight to video the story is smarmy nick cage plays johnny in a sleazy way sex in churches and other scenes that border on tastelesslike the scene in the laundry room taint this movie judge reinhold as the cuckold is okay but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done but it is a good film for trivia contests because so few people saw it,positive
783,thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called german independent series four for venice is not only awful but really awful so awful that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cashnick and charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession eva and luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth where eva works as a waitress and luis an artist nick indirectly causes eva to lose her job as an waitress luis and charlotte had an affair at the back of eva and nick luis cheated on eva by lying to her that he would be flying off to london to do something related to his artwork but the fact is he is flying off to venice with charlotte for an adultery holiday eva kidnapped nick and dragged her kids along to venice for confrontation the trip to venice ends up both nick and eva falling for one anotherthe presentation of the journey from germany to venice between nick and eva marks the failure of the comedy it not only look senseless but also draggy in the film nick try to seek help for several ways but it ends to no avail it is either the strangers around him who acts like morons or they are just simply dumbthe comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story while some of the problems that can be solved with common sense no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem they prefer to go through one big round to solve the problemit fails so bad that even the beautiful sceneries in venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film,negative
784,garson kanin wrote and directed this look at modern day las vegas and the gap between generations his first directorial effort since the s david janssen is somewhat miscast as a bigshot casino owner who reunites with his son robert drivas who looks disconcertingly like an older jason bateman janssen approaches every scene the same way defensively with a chip on his shoulder playing this role cool and laidback is asking too much from janssen who barks at everyone like a grouchy putupon husband he even chews out don rickles and makes him cry his son a neerdowell in search of his own identity makes hip comments about how young people look down on vegas give them another ten years and his disapproval of dads lifestyle causes friction brenda vaccaro is cute as a selfconscious secretary and edy willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition unfortunately where its at doesnt have much else going for it other than the nowdated ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids some quick ta shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the highstakes world of gamblingmost of which has been covered by now ad nauseum from,positive
785,casting bone to pick david jannsen was playing the father of robert drivas who was then yeah i realize hes supposed to be just out of college but clues in the script have him being a loafer and so hes probably in the script that still puts jannsen in parenting classes in junior high i assume the ama wrote medical miracle up in their year in medicine this movie hasnt aged very well at all and now its main appeal is just to see a snap shot of sin city circa and all the incessant smoking the weird hair drivas has an atomic comb over that makes him resemble a wellgroomed hip cousin it and trendy fashions that went along with it if anyone remembers lv wasnt exactly london the city coddled the mob and codger gamblers in those days drivas comes off as sexually ambiguous his dad thinks he might be gay in a sad irony drivas himself died of aids at and the soapy conflict is from the generation gap issue ahem as if one may call years a gap sonny boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino caesars palace and plies him with girls including the hornyformoney edy williams interestingly enough the son doesnt seem to mind being thought of as gay unusual for the time and a cute brenda vaccarro is nearby to swoon platonically over him what nudity there is is awfully lame just what was needed to pull the audience in for an r rating in the early days of the mpaa rating system which then was gmr and x the editing is horrible and theres stupidsilly overdubs by the committee a late s neoavantegarde comedy troupe that mercifully faded off the map within a couple of years don rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better casino two decades later not to give anything away but they wouldve dealt with mr rickles character with power tools and a hole in the desert back then a curiosity at best far from joshua logans usual caliber of work dosdias now go watch casino again,positive
786,i can only believe that garson kanin must have been two people the one who wrote the brilliant a double life and the funny born yesterday and cowrote such excellent screenplays as adams rib and pat and mike with his wife ruth gordon and then the one who wrote andor directed such tiresome sad drivel as bachelor mother some kind of a nut and this the cast tries but the script is so tired and clichd that even the efforts of the always wonderful brenda vaccaro are defeated the script sinks to its nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which janssens character tests drivass character to make sure hes not gay an ugly sequence but sadly one which could easily play in a film today ethnic jokes are now totally verboten but fag jokes are still good clean family fun,positive
787,i was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic private lessons which portrays the dream of any male teenagerprivate lessons ii has nothing to do with the title i mention its just a regular softcore cinemax flick that wont make a change in your life theres just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but thats it i watched this a long time ago but believe me this is just a regular boring soft core flickthe women are hot but thats not enough to rent or buy the movie my advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable,neutral
788,up until the last minutes i was thinking that this is possibly jackie chans worst movie excluding his pre work which i am not familiar with the final fight sequence changed all that it is long and good and intense indeed one of the highlights of chans career but to get to it you have to sit through a lot of comedy that might amuse fiveyearolds oh look someone threw a tomato at that guys face and endless football scenes not to mention the dubbing which includes the line how can i turn it off its not a tap watch to find out what it refers to dragon lord is worth renting for the final fight alone but the rest of the movie is only for jackie collectors and even then only for those whove already seen at least of his other movies,neutral
789,when i sat down to watch this film i actually expected quite a bit as the plot takes on quite complex issues using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach still unfortunately despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between muslim and western culture adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gayslesbians it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film this leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal withhowever this does not mean that the film is directly bad as its rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing the film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep this has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts by this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciationeven if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when the ball drops this way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard clich that becomes ridiculous in its happyending nothing is left out in the hollywood like ending so even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages one cant help but roll eyes towards the resolution personally i was close to shouting finish already at the screenthere were some decent acting in the film and the two young female central characters had some good moments so did their parents and other bicharacters however the handsome irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism he didnt even appear very likable but rather self involved despite his good deeds which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strainedi give the film a as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from the script and cast had many good believable characters giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others had the letdowns not been this disappointing id easily give the film a or if you enjoyed this film id recommend the film east is east which i think is an as good if not better rendering of cultural conflict as well as being amusing and engaging,positive

791,an executive very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life meets a boy with down syndrome escaped from a residence both characters feel very alone and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life with this argument the somehow amelielike atmosphere and the sentimental music i didnt expect but a moralistic disgusting movie anyway as there were some interesting scenes the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy and the interpretation of both actors daniel auteil and pasqal duquenne was very good i decided to go on watching the movie the french cinema in general has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life opposed to the more stereotyped american cinema but because of that it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending with the impossible death of the boy the charming tone the happiness of the executives family the cheap moral the unbearable laughter of the daughters the guy waving from heaven as michael landon really nasty in my humble opinion,neutral
792,first of all i was expecting caged heat to be along the same lines as ilsa the wicked warden boy was i wrong in no way is this film s exploitation chix in chains or women in prison sure the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison who wear street clothes btw quite comical but nothing happensthere arent strong rivalries no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape and no inmates make out there are shower scenes that i suspect is just recycled footage but no fights breaks out no one is seduced here or anywhere for that matter aside from the lack of plot unconvincing unsympathetic and flat characters a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to free their fellow inmatespuhlease the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunsetas opposed to letting this mess continuei feel scammed,positive

794,towards the end of this thriller ally sheedys gaunt latterday image is used creatively to make up more than one hauntingly evil image she convinces one that if a nasty bette davistype role were to come her way she could carry it off brilliantly unfortunately i cant find many other reasons for seeing this if youve wondered what sheedy looks like in a pair of oldfashioned glasses but why should anyone then heres your answer for the rest sally kirklands sexstarved crazy woman is really tiresome and even if you like this sort of thing more than i do youll have to admit that the tension sags badly during these scenes savages drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least its a small role of the leading actors nicholas walker inspires no sympathy at all for paul kellers plight and his acting is wooden dara tomanovich is better and during her scenes with sheedy the level rises a little sheedys meticulous understated performance though she often seems to be on automatic pilot is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest the sets are drab the camerawork undistinguished,negative
795,where to start if this movie had been a dark comedy i would say it was fannntastic unfortunately for me and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare mind you that was the price i paid got it from walmart this movie was meant to be a thriller the only thrill i got was watching kirklands lousy rendition of anne wilkes from misery sans snowy woodland area if you want a good laugh on a rainy friday night with some friends then i highly recommend this movie but if you want to watch something at least half way decent then dont even botheri for one enjoy crappy films the worse the better in most cases but wow i meant wow the only person in the entire film that didnt stink it up was the little boy played by vincent berry the only reason why i even give it stars is because it gave me something to do,neutral

797,i had quite high hopes for this film even though it got a bad review in the paper i was extremely tolerant and sat through the entire film i felt quite sick by the endalthough i am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinemai thouroughly enjoyed both woody allens everything you ever wanted to know about sex and michael hannekes funny gamesi found the directors obsession with this tenyearold wanting to drink womens milk totally sickening and when the film climaxed in an orgy where the boy drinks both his mothers milk as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film i almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it isdont get me wrong i enjoy the vast majority of european cinema as well as independently made films so this flick should have pleased me enormously avoid this film at all costs it should be relegated to the annals of history as a lesson in bad cinema,negative
798,plan b is strictly bythenumbers fare except for one thing i surprisingly found it to be rather insultingjon cryer is the star of this film and plays his usual smarmy egotistical snotty character that was actually endearing in pretty in pink and has not been amusing ever since grating doesnt even begin to describe his performance ricky mark matheisen is a muscular blonde struggling actor who gasp is only worried about his hair and getting laid talk about a stock characterugh at least the other three characters are somewhat engaging lisa darr and lance guest play a grounded optimistic caring couple who are struggling to conceive since they are not whiny drama queens however their roles are apparently considered boring and they arent given enough screen time sara mornell rounds out the cast by playing gina your usual nice and goodlooking young woman who just cant seem to find the right partner in love ive seen this character a million times before but at least her performance overcomes some of the shortfalls caused by the predictability of her situationwhat startled me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes they introduced a russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked he was portrayed as being wild ignorant and amazingly shallow they were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays gina decides to be gay for a while since she isnt having any luck with guys honestly that wasnt that bad except they really went overboard when gina brought a lesbian to a christmas party her friends were throwing her lesbian date had very short hair like im sure all lesbians do she also got quite upset like im sure all lesbians do when gina had the nerve to put on lipstick finally her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when gina expresses her disappointment of course we all know how gay people cant stay faithful for so much as a couple of hours much less months or even years right please note the sarcasm in that statement thank youthis film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but cryers unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema,neutral
799,i had the misfortune to sit through the full minutes of what in my opinion is this shockingly bad film it fails on pretty much all levels the cast is awful the acting ham at best and the plot lacks any depth leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story linesplan b has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and i found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedya bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie,neutral
800,even though theres a repertoire of over films to choose from this succubus is often named as the best jess franco film heck even the legendary filmmaker fritz lang counts succubus among his personal favorites so maybe its me but i thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie the opening is great though and shows janine reynaud performing an sm act on stage its all downhill from here unfortunately reynauds character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score this could have been his greatest film indeed if it wasnt for the lame and uninteresting story its supposed to be psychedelic but id say sophomoric is a better term to describe whats shown here half of the time you dont have a clue whats going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of minutes seems to last ages this most certainly isnt francos best film according to me i wouldnt even recommend it to diehard exploitation fans if youre looking for more superior jess franco film try to get your hands on las vampiras the awful dr orloff or female vampire,positive
801,ive come to realise from watching euro horror especially films made by cult luminary jess franco that you cant expect a plot that makes much sense however franco has gone overboard with this film and despite a surreal atmosphere and the films reputation as one of the directors best succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film ive got to admit that i saw the american cut version which runs at about minutes but unless it was just the logic that was cut im sure the longer european version is just as boring the plot has something to do with a woman marauding around practicing sm and talking rubbish and its all really boring theres no gore and the sex is dull and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film i had difficulty making it all the way to the end i have to say that the locations look good and franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere but the positive elements end there jess franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films but this looks like it was one he made for the money and overall i recommend skipping it and seeing some of the directors more interesting works,neutral
802,succubus the edited version of necronomicon getrumte snden is a struggle to sit through even at a lean minutes any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious euro horror tripe and i may have slipped into a comajess franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on class a hallucinogenics since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever apparently this is one of the better of his films its hard to believe that there are worse efforts out therethe unfathomable plot deals with francos usual themes of sex violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of sm for good measure and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tediousi may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy euro horror again life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this,negative
803,a disappointing filmthe story established our protagonist as chrissy a young rather sullen individual drifting not doing much actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didnt surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives its a pity though chrissy seem like interesting characterstory was predictable and at times felt quite formulated so the question now is when are we going to see the campions jacksons and the tamahoris breaking ground with compelling cinematicallytold stories that will inspire rather than entertain for the toll of two hourstechnically a disgusting shot film,negative
804,kubrick meets king it sounded so promising back in the spring of i remember then the movie came out and the kubrick cultists have been bickering with the king cultists ever sincethe king cultists say stanley kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it the kubrick cultists dont give a damn about kings story they talk about steadicams tracking shots camera anglesthis is a film they insist it should be considered on its own as it happens both camps are correct unfortunatelyif one views it purely as an adaptation of kings novel the shining is indeed a failure a wasted opportunity a series of botched narrative gambits i used to blame that on kubricks screenwriter the writer diane johnson author of le marriage laffaire le divorce etc has a reputation as an novelist of social manners maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics but the little bluecollar town of sidewinder colorado doesnt exist on any map in her francophile universe kubrick the anglophile probably found her congenial however he of course is the real auteur and considered on its own merits his screenplay for the shining with its mishmash of abnormal psychology rationalism supernaturalism and implied reincarnation just doesnt stand up to logical analysisim willing to consider kubricks shining on its own terms im even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horrorgenre movie but it doesnt succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation alienation and madness either parsed either way the film pretty much falls apartare the horrors of the overlook hotel real or do they exist only in the mind first as prescient nightmares suffered by little danny torrance then as the hallucinations of his father one notes how whenever jack torrance is seen talking to a ghost he is in fact looking into a mirror one notes how the hotels frozen topiaryhedge maze appears to symbolize jacks stunted convoluted psyche very deep stuffbut if indeed the overlooks ghosts are purely manifestations of jack torrances growing insanity then who exactly lets the trapped jack out of the hotel kitchens deadbolted walk in closet so that he can go on his climactic axwielding rampageand can anyone explain with a straight face that blackandwhite photograph helpfully labelled of nicholson as a tuxedoed partygoer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotelballroom wall during the films closing seconds are we to seriously conclude that jack torrances bad craziness stems from a some sort of past life experience and if you swallow that since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selvesmaybe kubrick didnt care about his storyline maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror whatever the case the film tries to hedge its narrative bets to have it both ways rational and supernatural as a result the story is a mess this movie hasnt improved with age and it certainly doesnt improve with repeated viewingsi dont deny that a few moments of fear claustrophobia and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long long film but those gushing elevators o blood seen repeatedly in little dannys visions are absurd and laughable and jack torrances infamous tag lines wendy im home and heeeeeeres johnny merely puncture the movies dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy i know i sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief whew glad we dont have to take this stuff seriously finally kubrick is completely at sea or else utterly cynical during those scenes in which wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son a foyer full of mummified guests all sitting there dead in their party hats yikes now i really am afraidgiven jack nicholsons brilliance over the years one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeballrolling eyebrowwiggling scenerychomping performance that the director wanted the performance of shelley duvall as a sort of female version of don knotts in the ghost and mr chicken is best passed over in silencethis movie simply doesnt succeed not as an adaptation not on its own terms it probably merits a out of but im giving it a because it has been so grotesquely overrated in this forum,neutral
805,i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in when first released many reviewers out there arent old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between stanley kubrick and steven king the enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed master director put this multilayered supernatural story on the screen salems lot had already been ruined in the late s as a tv miniseries directed by tobe hooper he of texas chainsaw massacre fame and was badly handled turning the major villain of the book into a chiller theatre vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise fans hoped that a director of kubricks stature would succeed where hooper had failed it didnt happensure this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments its all downhill jack nicholson cannot be anything but jack nicholson hes always crazy and didnt bring anything to his role here i dont care that many reviewers here think hes all that in this clinker the heres johnny bit notwithstandinghes just awful in this movie so is everyone else for that matter scatman crothers character dick halloran was essential to the plot of the book yet kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest shock sequences ever put on film i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at booing repeatedly during the last minutes of this wretched flick those that stayed that ismany left kings books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters and often metaphysically kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately dont really care what happens to whomthis movie still stinks and why so many think its a horror masterpiece is beyond me,neutral
806,i hate this movie it was nothing like the book and just thinking about it makes me mad if you watch the movie before reading the book then yeah its a good movie but kings book was amazing and this movie was nothing like it i mean the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different the ending for example so in the book it is extremely intense and danny and wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze yeah there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it another part that made me angry was that jack just kills mr halloran what the heck he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasnt important overall it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off,negative
807,many king fans hate this because it departed from the book but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump that notwithstanding the movie does fail completely but it fails entirely on film terms id like to smack the people who tell me its the scariest movie ever made i always follow up with the question really exactly what scene scared you every fan ive asked goes silent occasionally someone at a loss for a decent scare there are none names the grapejuiceshootingoutofelevators shtick if youre afraid of that i dont know what to tell you except maybe that youre easily scared i just rolled my eyes watching these zgrade horror ideas play out in this schlocky incoherent movieone place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get mr halloran up to the overlook only to kill him with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes halloran forever to walk down really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film oh and nice choice for mr hallorans artwork stanley black light afronymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie has there ever been a more off outofplace shot in any movie ever madei consider it a miracle that i was eventually able to bypass this turd and agree that kubricks is a truly important film given the immense bad will generated by both this stupid stupid movie and the cult of fawning but inarticulate kubrick fanboys who couldnt describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the library of congress in front of them toss in the grotesque overacting of jack nicholson the introduction of dumb oneliners at tense moments and the razzie nominated performance of shelly duvall and you have a very crappy movie,neutral
808,these writings write about the end of the plot so dont read it if you havent seen this rubbishi found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror if i owned a video store id put it in the boring section this film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socksthis film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary well i drive to work and back and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats almost every day and trust me its not scary it even starts with minutes of some people driving even the little kid does it too round and round he goes and he never stops whats so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour i think nothing and if you watch it you will not think so toothe family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason thats all that happens and as you can see its rubbish,negative
809,not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the s but not for the st century,positive
810,ladies and gentlemenplease dont get fooled by a stanley kubrick film tagthis is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever madehorror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror filmin shiningthere is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naivefoolish attempt made to create chilling horroreveryone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from realityall that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good tooa word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lostlazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to dothere is not much to be said of a baldcolored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actorno need to blame the bad weather for the tragedyit cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes,neutral
811,ok honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great its really not there were two good things that came out of this movie jacks performance he was very good i can tip my hat for him dannys performance he was good no other then that it got pretty stupid and what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy she was so bad she looked the same every time she got scared the problem with this movie was the ending i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently and the over all movie was just stupid the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off,positive
812,i am going to keep this shortthis adaption of the wonderful king book is a bad joke and nothing moreof course there are many kubrick and nickolson fans in this site andas a resultthis movie has mysteriously find its way in the topjack nicholson is laughable as torrance and so is shelley duvallthe storythat has nothing to do with the bookis an incoherent mess and the characters of jack and wendy torrance are complete jokesmy advice to anyone that hasnt read the book and wants to understand the characters of this storystick to the tv series oh and the people who are saying that kubrick had every right to destroy the king story cause king isnot a good writer should stick to reviewing masterpieces like eyes wide shut,neutral
813,after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie i knew what was supposed to happen i had high expectations of the movie because of the rating the only reason i give this movie a out of stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie i have a couple main points for not liking this movie spoilers the casting jack nicholson barely fits into jack torrences character also i would have never picked shelly duvall for wendy i pictured wendy much differently i can see why they picked jack nicholson though the grin the pointy eyebrows but hes not supposed to really look evil hes supposed to look normal and he turns evil also they make one of the worst movie couples danny was alright he needed more life though he acted way to droney the screenplay they cut out so many things that were in the book and added things some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted changed or handled wrongly some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing the hedge animals the roque mallet the elevator were not in the movie and it was and half hours i was extremely irritated the ending the ending was changed completly halorann died jack froze to death wendy never got hurtthe overlook didnt blow up the ending was so cool in the book and the movie messed it up so horribly i was apalled hallorann was never supposed to die but jack killed him with an ax if they wanted to kill him at least have jack use a roque mallet you never even saw a roque mallet during the whole moviethere are other things that i didnt like about the movie but there are things that were all right the camera angels were cool the blood coming out of the elevator didnt happen in the book was cool but maybe i was too irritated that the movie didnt go with the book to try to be scared at all i reccomend reading the book before you see this movie i applaud stephen king for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis stanley kubrik any more i would never have done that i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day i cant wait to see the hour version at least it has the hedge animalsrating,neutral
814,this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen spoilers ahead first of all the plot is stupid the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid has a gift the shining this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because well he feels like it why else would he do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse which is utterly disgusting somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid and the woman take the black mans vehicle and leave the father who dies within minutes of hypothermia most movies arent a complete waste of time but this falls right into that category the music is trashy the characters are corny except jack nicholson who is a good actor the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit the ending is very predictable the storyline is slow tedious and boring this movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie at all costs im surprised its gotten such a high rating on imdb,negative
815,one star thats all this documentary deserves i havent felt this disappointed in watching a movie let alone a documentary in quite some timeim a big fan of the walking with series including its nigel marvin spinoffs for all their gleeful fun yet informative information and although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures the subject is still interesting and unique to explore having seen all the other docs from the series i figured i need to see this one as well especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other placeswell for those of you who put up a good review of this doc what were you thinking lolthough the information that they were able to get through was interesting the presentation failed in every other way possible it had a terrible flow was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place horrible effects that includes the few moments of cgi and especially the makeup effects and overused mtvstyle camera effectsspeaking of the makeup effects one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a s maninsuit horror movie well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous none of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositionsthe worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way or looks remotely real it doesnt even look like it was taken seriously it also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had remember the episode in walking with dinosaurs of the fate of the ornithochirus sp that episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time i watch it its this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all when you are more engaged in the subject and its own personal story even one that is just speculation you care more about the facts surrounding itthe only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration at least in the bbc version i saw and the music otherwise do not bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh which i did frequently but usually followed by rolling eyes this does not belong on the shelf with the other walking with docsand does it make sense to learn that this doc was not produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series hmmm,neutral
816,ok if youre looking for another bastketball diaries this is completely the wrong filmi revolves around two brothers max the younger has a major cocaine addiction adam the eldest is a doctor this movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible it however does not it shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present most of the movie focus is on max and his parting ways eventually adam can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well perscription drugsthis movie has almost no climax doesnt descend into what cocaine really does to you has boring and lowbudget scenes and the acting of the eldest brother adam is horrifici have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards it is not a heartwencher if you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs rent if not buy the basketball diaries and notice the differencetry to avoid this movie but if you think you will enjoy try and see for yourself,neutral
817,the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being smart one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the titlei honestly didnt like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose but what i dont get is why there is so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however its visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs monotonic scenes dynamic cut music and abrupt noisesthe movies storyline is very simple most of whats going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cutsi will say openly that this movie didnt meet my expetations a tiny bit,neutral
818,this has to be by far the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last years when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldnt be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films and he was a pretty fair actor wrong no one should waste their time on this film i fast forwarded through percent of it and i dont feel that i missed a thing,neutral
819,it is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on imdb because i would not have hesitated in fact i would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars i like many others bought this film thinking that because it has michael madsen in it it could be good no chance this film was shocking imagine a movie length the bold and the beautiful well primal instinct did not even come close to that good and i had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length the bold and the beautiful michael madsen how could you do this to us the worst part is i didnt fast forward a bit i was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad filmwhere do i start directing zero stars screenplay zero stars acting zero stars cinematography zero stars digital effects zero stars production design zero stars makeup zero stars casting zero stars editing zero stars trailer half a star graphic design half a star dvd menu half a starhowever i think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is so for that reason i am happy that i saw this film just so that i have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list,neutral
820,this has to be the worst movie i have seen madsen fans dont be drawn into this like i was he is only in it for a maximum of five minutes this movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as tv had been destroyed,negative
821,a bdsm subculture of los angeles serves as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess plainly a vanity piece for its topbilled player celia xavier who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters vanessa and celia a question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the county of los angeles while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon cdroms but when disaster befalls mistress vanessa virtuous celia determined to unearth her sisters vicious attacker begins a new job as a sex slave at the private castle club where the specialty of the house is a dungeon party two fbi field agents whose deployment to the vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet bdsm sites in addition to a los angeles police department homicide detective are assigned to investigate the crime while endeavouring to provide security for celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her flaws in logic and continuity abound such as a homicide being allocated to lapds operationssouth bureau a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic postproduction editing and sound reproduction the mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movies end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario one solid acting turn appears among this slag stan abe as a zealous fbi agent,neutral
822,this is not michael madsens fault he was hardly in it this movie was just awful if you want to laugh and be bored go ahead and watch this movie words cannot describe how idiotic it is sorry michael the cinematography was dark all the other actors are unknowns when watching it it feels like a soft porn but with no nudity or heated scenes this movie had sexual overtones since it is about a underground s m killer the acting was bad except michael madsens parts he looked like he wanted to laugh i hope he got paid well for this lousy movie it is something i would not be proud of it is not even a b movie for cable it is more like a f and it should never be shown ever,negative
823,i just watched this film minutes ago and i still have no idea what i just watched mainly i think its a film about an internet sm star of cd roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online shes murdered by someone which causes her sister and a crack team of fbi agents to investigate the death the local homicide division of big city usa is also investigating though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the cd roms which he claims are as realistic as the real thing i know wowmichael madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him hes in the film for about minutes and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason i wont even explain the ending because quite frankly i cant make it out myself but before the final scene were treated to a or minute montage of everything in the film honestly they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and allall in all stay away from this film i got it because i love bad movies and i love michael madsen i really could have used that some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied like playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly that for minutes would be much more entertaining,positive
824,i agree totally with the last commenter this could be the worst movie ever made i too had to fast forward through most of this movie michael madsen must have done this movie as a favor to someonethe picture quality is grainy all the way through and what little plot there isis just plain stupid i give this movie a out of if i could give it a lower score i would dont waste your time on this movie or youll regret it,negative
825,the only redeeming part of this movie was the price i paid at least all i lost was and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb the crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat when the female lead and the fbi guy went to the alleged killers location mr fbi handed the female a revolver when the alleged killer came out the door the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic one is left to ponder would an fbp agent hand a weapon to a civilian i think not ms xavier appears to be a very attractive female it is too bad the r rating did not allow much of her to be seen it would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out,positive

827,i saw and liked the first two a lot really especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first and its a story standing alone you dont have to know the first movie i liked that in the free willy movies toobut the third here is absolutely useless i tried it with a friend of mine because we both liked the first two we decided to stop after a good half an hour the movie is okay there are funny parts in it alright but what for timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies what lion king is for me is a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already plus telling the story from their point of view but what for id really like to know you know the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one is really nice but what comes after is mostly unnecessary i guess many people liked timon and pumba and so do i really yet for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny no chance most of it wasnt funny at all at least for me btw what was the movie about anyway was it a about timon and pumba or b an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie i tend to choose option b and im very disappointed about itif you like to see stories like the story behind xy you should see rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman thats really funny and no try to get more out of hamlet then it has,positive
828,a dedicated fan to the tlk movies with the first one being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel disney has produced along comes this film now im not arguing with animation voice work music but this is no more than a timonpumbaa screwloose in the tlk atmosphere although it isnt bad it doesnt add anything basically this movie is one big joke and thats about all that saves it make a real tlk disney the potential is there,neutral
829,having watched both the lion king and lion king ii and enjoyed both thoroughly i thought lion king might be worth watching what a disappointment disney must be getting desperate for revenuesespecially now that they lost the deal with pixarbasically they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editors floor or garbage can and glued them together to make aquick buck unlike lk i ii both of which had strong story linesthis movie hardly has a story at all while the characters and animation are always fun to look at there is simply not enough material here for a movie some of the bits could have been good nd disk fillers on the original offeringsdisney shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick bucknext time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work,positive
830,i found this to be an utter waste of time effort and money i know disney always displays lack of creativity when making straighttovideo films but rehashing the plot of the original film with a new perspective is an alltime lowsoon theyll just be rereleasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a new version of the movie we all love nathan lane surprisingly returns to his role of timon yet again timon and pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original lion king embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it really happenedas they see itof course timon is now the hero of the story yadda yadda yadda blah blah blahthe musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap the vocal talents are impressive for a video feature but then again when was the last time you remember matthew broderick whoopi goldberg or nathan lane being in anything of real commercial substance overall if you liked the original youll hate this its insulting because its unfair to children and adults alike and that about sums it up,neutral
831,there really wasnt much of a story in this film it loosely based itself off the events in the first lion king movie it is supposed to be how timon and pumbaa met via their aloneness but there isnt much more than thatit mixes some scenes from the original then it ablibs about how this movie changed them a little bit but still is that it i was hoping for something a little more instead all i have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanationi guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the lion king universe then this is it but other than that it does little justice for the animators disney really should stop these directtovideo productions it really was quite boring and could have used jason statham d,neutral
832,i give this film its props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted but i couldnt get past the implausibility of the whole thingfirst and foremost a game built around the notion of russian roulette that has to fill on hour the big problem is that if you are doing a live show you run the possibility that your first contestant will be the one unlucky enough to draw the real bullet then what do you do you have minutes of show to fill and nothing to show the corollary is that okay you get to the end and the first five contestants survive which means number six has the bullet and cant possibly get the payout he isnt going to shoot himself at that point so its kind of anticlimatic second problem almost as big human nature people are going to flinch panic soil their underwear and do things that would otherwise not make very good television too much randomness thats why real reality television is actually tightly scripted and even more tightly editedthe only random thing is the performance artists rant about female sacrifices which were actually rare historically even that was predictable since she went through with shooting herself to no effect we are led to believe the shows ratings would increase while it was going on at am in the morning unlikely with the token asian girl announcing each boost in ratingsa point on race and sex big surprise the movies two minority one gay and two female contestants are the ones who survive so we are left with the two white males and of course the slightly less likable of them is the one who buys it the purpose of such a show would be its randomness but the guy you like the least is the guy who diesthe climax is that after spending two hours fighting for televised suicide the eva mendes character mendes produced and starred in this thing so she has no one to blame but herself actually grows a conscience when someone dies what did she think was going to happen she is promptly shot by a bystander angry about the whole thing motives never explained and the show went on to be a big hit really the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some grounding in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous like network this is neither,neutral
833,live yes but not kickingtrue story some time ago a dutch tv station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show a contest rather the main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure for realthe country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd saying it was appalling immoral whatisthisworldcomingto and the like in a way i had to agreeas the months passed the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not instead of running the countrythe show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead and up to the last moment the country was up in arms the prime minister making speeches every newspaper writing about it everyone in the country holding their breaths and the network pushed on towards a new frontier in television and they definitely succeeded in doing just that they pushed the envelopethe show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live whilst she would die shortly afterand then in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax the woman was not ill but all the candidates were there was no kidney auction the whole show that with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions built up for months to a fantastic climax was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors the man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney diseasenow this is television leaving everybody far behind in amazementdont give me a poorly acted poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a russian roulette show on american tvas ifspoiler as if im going to believe they would get this through the fcc as if im going to believe this would get through the us supreme court on the basis of free expression as if im gonna believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on airits all been done before watch running man with arnold instead at least it had a semi good endingspoiler this is an appallingly bad piece of film together with a ridiculous ending so she gets shot in the end is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice dont take my word for it but i would say this leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead youll get more quality,neutral

841,first it takes a full half hour to get hackman out of jail and to start doing the job what a waste of time we all know hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences then hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere simply proving to us that hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters again another minutes then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife all of this should have taken minutes at most simply as a setup for the real action intrigue and plot twists by the time the real action gets going i was so bored that i just wanted the movie to end hackman is great as usual and the other actors as well but this is a dud of the first magnitude,neutral
842,there are really two sections of this film firstly theres the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the the simpsons troy mcclure should be doing the narrationthen the rest of the film begins starting off with a title song which really doesnt fit in with the rest of the film which while technically ok is killed by a vague inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters but characters that make no sensethis is especially so with mickey rooneys spiventa who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the organisation the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out in that case he wouldve been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character which in the end he still isthe overall problem of the film is that its totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy its as if the filmmakers didnt have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusionsput simply the film fails on all levels,neutral
843,stanley kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things action and thrills the domino principle features gene hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task richard widmark edward albert and eli wallach are his operatives they presumably work for the government but that like most of the movies plot line is never made clear hackman asks a lot of questions that never get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere while it strives to be like night moves and the parallax view the domino principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom the film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it kramers direction is devoid of any style its a very sunny moviethe acting is fine with hackman proving hes pretty much incapable of being bad widmark and wallach are suitably nasty and albert is well cast as widmarks cruel lackey even the usually obnoxious mickey rooney is pretty good as hackmans sidekick one oddity however is the casting of candice bergen as hackmans wife were told shes done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang kramers idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig its a role better suited for the likes of valerie perrine or susan tyrell,neutral

845,the domino principle is without question one of the worst thrillers ever made hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point youll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream i give uphow gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecksi hope they spent their money well,negative
846,this film is notable for three reasonsfirst apparently capitalizing on the success of the two superman serials this low budget feature was made and released to theaters marking george reeves and phyllis coates initial appearances as clark kent superman and lois lane part of the opening is reused in the series outside the town of silby a sixmile deep oil well penetrates the hollow earth allowing the molemen to come to the surface forget about the other holes those in the plotsecond unlike most sf invasion films of the fifties the hero plays a dominant and controlling force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes no mild mannered reporter here clark kent knowledgeable and selfassertive grabs control of the situation throughout ill handle this even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a moleman as superman he is gentler than clark towards the feisty lois but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as nazi storm troopers third you will notice that the transition from the fleisherlike cartoon animated flying of superman in the two serials to the live action flying in the adventures of superman had not yet been made,neutral

849,i just got the uk disc special edition of superman for about the additional stuff includes the feature superman and the molemen so i slapped it into the dvd player last night and here are my findingssome initial disappointment i hadnt checked and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials im not a huge fan of george reeves as superman and i hadnt seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn but hey ho never mindthis black and white production runs for less than an hour it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves early tv series a twoparter put together for cinema release although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series in any event its an odd choice for reasons ill get to later im of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets so there were no major surprises here even so for a low budget movie this one is really low budgetthe story concerns the small town of silsby population which puzzlingly is also home to the worlds deepest oil well miles the story opens with the wells foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well at the behest of the oil company as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern miles down a couple of odd little guys small in stature big in head black in jumpsuit and bushy in eyebrow emerge from the cappedoff drillshaft and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their facesa deep breath now here is the remaining plot of the picture the little guys scare some kids so jeff corey playing the towns rampant xenophobe incites some pals to kill these creatures superman steps in moderately ineffectually and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital coreys pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed but he escapes and legs it down the shaft corey incites a lynch mob despite the sheriff arresting him to hang the hospitalised moleman superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows a total of molemen emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey i call this an aargh gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go aargh and superman saves him he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved the molemen go back down the shaft the enddespite the film only being an hour long there is an inordinate amount of creeping around bewareing and pursuing i have left out all the moleman creeps from a to b looking out to make sure noone is following him stuff the molemen are never engaged in any way whatsoever they have no dialogue they just turn up get persecuted and go back they do look a little creepy but they are hardly the bugeyed monsters that the towns reaction impliesreeves is quite a good clark kent very much a hardnosed reporter much more so than phyllis coates rather indifferent lois lane but he is a terrible terrible superman not only does he not look the part at least his hair is dyed black in this which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the tv episodes the way he plays it is all wrong in my book im sure he was told to strike the pose which superman does constantly but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips not fists on ribs and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher he doesnt actually wag his finger in remonstration but he may as well have doneand superman does a huge amount of walking around i say a huge amount he isnt actually in it all that much and a bit of running he takes off and lands a couple of times but isnt seen in flight at any point oh some bullets bounce off him and he uses telescopic vision as clark but with no accompanying visual effect in fact visual effects are conspicuous by their absence and the few which are present arent very goodive tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time but even by those standards i think its a pretty threadbare effort thankfully production standards on the tv series were higher and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to themsomething of a disappointment i shant be watching it again,neutral

869,when you see boris karloff and bela lugosi as costars you expect to find a well done horror movie but this was actually quite different representing as it did what i would describe as an early effort at science fiction karloff and lugosi both play scientists rukh and benet respectively competitors to an extent until rukh wins benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory the science here was to say the least a bit rough around the edges thus science fiction with the emphasis on the fiction but somehow rukh harnesses some sort of ray from andromeda that allows him to look at the earth several thousand million years ago in that pre historic time a huge meteorite slammed into africa leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call radium x which can heal and destroy a large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in africa on a search for the meteorite deposits which rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as wellkarloff and lugosi were both pretty good here lugosi pulls off a role in which hes the good guy pretty well although i frankly found him a bit unconvincing especially during the scenes set in africa the story also plodded along a bit and while it held my attention it didnt captivate me given that this is really a scifi rather than a horror flick and that scifi was in its very early stages i suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack it was ok nothing more but also nothing less than that,positive

876,a film with very little positive to say for itfirstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any dramabesides being remarkably slow the empty acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again i lost count of how many times i had seen that field at night or that bit of cracked earthit also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience dont know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused so with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that its fine we find jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre beth has a key to a warehouse of books there are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie much later in fact too lateand on the point of the acre horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary and also if theyre meant to be an acre big then make them sothere is also a frightening lack of reasonability as beth the best performer in the piece followed by jefferson the cop suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on medicationwith the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child did he crawl out of the window hes six months old the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene bad plinky plonk horror music fails to add atmosphereoften bad films can be amusing but not the empty acre which is just bad,negative
877,as an inspiring director myself this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind shot with low end digital camera probably with mm adapter for dof the editing is good acting decent sound effects arent too over the top i would have give it a for an indie film but the story arent that interesting its more on the drama side character developments than a horror flickits not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out or sit down with popcorn to just enjoyhonestly this movie would be good if we were still in the sthis movie is about a family who has a dry field and that is just that,positive
878,i saw this film on its release and have watched it or more times including last week i regret i have to be a voice of dissension with regard to mr branaghs performancethis is really a glorious sumptuous film to say nothing of ambitious at over hours long beautifully shot and designed derek jacobi julie christie kate winslet richard briers and many others do fine jobs then theres kenneth branagh if ever there was a vanity project for an actor this is it and mr branagh spares nothing in putting the ham in hamlet from the stunt casting which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast jack lemmon to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of naturalness to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others his performance confirms that while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary he has never been a great film actor the scenery budget could be charged to catering mr branagh eats so much of it his performance is a perfect example of why people dont go to see shakespeare full of sound and fury signifying nothing and if there is fault to his direction it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performanceno matter what theories people may posit on the bard he was after all is said and done a playwright the brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless although there is no right way to play his plays there is most certainly great acting good acting and bad acting shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of hamlet itself it amazes me how mr branagh mouthed it but did not hear it it was an example of spending too much time working out how hes going to say something and too little figuring out what hes sayingwhile mr branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it his direction has always been better than his acting i still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming shakespeare he set a great template for other productions and it would be interesting to see him onstage from about rows back but i do hope he chooses to direct more and act lessis it worth seeing certainly there are many little joys to be found in the film but its a long long movie and by the end one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it,positive
879,this ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of hamlet to ever reach the screen branaghs approach to the material can only be described as vulgar going to such lengths as depicting ophelia in a straight jacket having fortinbras army appear suddenly on the horizon looking very much like the climax of monty python and the holy grail when the palace is apparently guarded only by francisco who shouts the very unshakespearean cry of ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack before being gunned down and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of jimmy cagneys bottom and mary pickfords katebranagh chose to set his film in an edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed and branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of hamlet and olphelias relationship treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass windowthe uncut text does allow branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime more footage of kenneth branagh this is never so apparent as in the how all occasions inform against me speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film at least thats how it feels which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of gone with the winds ill never be hungry again this may serve branaghs ego but it does not serve shakespeare or the speech when i saw the film in the theater i leaned over to my companion and snickered great moments with mr hamlet branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last when he attempts to outdo the olivier film and its justly celebrated death of claudius by having hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch impaling him with a sword branaghs dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through claudius heart with a super heros bulls eye the only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so offthewall funnywhile this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy it is in fact nothing but a starstudded display of a oncetalented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism the emperor has no clothes and this hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one mans ego out of control,neutral
880,despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals this movie is not for everyonethe story is very similar to other movies in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family she does that by choosing some kind of sport and with the help of a local boy that for some reason falls in love with her she confronts her problems and winsin girlfight its boxing in bend it like beckham its soccer and now its kung fubut fighter is much inferior product than these two it was simply embarrassing to watch it semra turan the actress that playing the role of a teenage girl maybe can do a lot of things but one thing she cant do is to act her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy the dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotions are dreadful her body and facial language are of amateur actress badly instructed by the director the rest of the cast is a little better but they just cannot save this clich movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offereven the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this its just so boring the slow motion was really unnecessary the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions not actually fighting not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys and knocks them off their feet the only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because its european its very easy to publicize this movie a first martial arts film from denmark but dont be fooled its not its just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems which are by the way not really convincingbad movie with embarrassing lines acting and story,neutral

886,what has ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way this movie begins like a primer for film students on irish cinematic cliches unctuous priests spitting before handshakes town square cattle marts cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music quickly however it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big daddyo of irish cliches religous strife it concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her catholicfathered child is educated which would seem like a reasonable enough wish though not to the s county wexford villagers she has to live with rather than send them to a catholic school she decides to up and leave for belfast then scotland where a few more cliches are reguritated while shes there her father who looks eerily like george lucas and family back home are subjected to a boycott which turns very nasty im not going to give away the ending not because i think people should go see this movie but because its not very interesting one of the problems with the film is the central character were supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life the villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it in addition it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current northern ireland peace process the woman is told by her lawyer that she must lay down preconditions for her return the film is allegedly based on a true story but its themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches in the past,neutral

902,there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring just a notch above lowbrow thanks to freeman and spacey who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films the bad guys are as laughable and action as near nonexistent as justin timberlakes acting i hate to knock the guy but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte the betterthe movie isnt all badjust mostly i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man he deserves it and unlike his fellow musician and costar he can act kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars out of tenhes not that goodwhen all is said and done the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudoaction poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters all in all ts just plain boring that being said rent this when you are suffering from insomnia,negative
903,oh dear god this was horrible there is bad then there was this this movie makes no sense at all it runs all over the map and isnt clear about what its saying at all the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman the fact that edison isnt a real city takes away since i live in vancouver watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable why didnt they make it a real city the only writing that was decent wastilman in which john heard did a fantastic job he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time and the movie be a washout too bad hopefully someone important will see it and at least give john heard credit where credit is due and hire him as lead bad guy again which is where he should be on the a list,neutral
904,the movie itself is not too bad many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script but it is watchable what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies and on top of that for movies like this one i have to admit i had never heard the mans name before watching this but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed the voice is crap the face is a bad ripoff of legolas the posture is horrible and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them said to say i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only too bad i was wrong these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance and they are the main reason i give this a i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast and cannot believe it,neutral
905,pathetic worse than a bad madefortv movie i cant believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick for some reason morgan freemans character is constantly talking about and saying pussy when referring to nsync boys girlfriend morgan freeman calling women pussy is just awkward what the hell were the people behind this film thinking too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting confusing camera angles a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearablei rented this flop with low expectations but well it really sucked,negative
906,timberlakes performance almost made attack the screen it wasnt all bad i just think the reporters role was wrong for himll cool j played the typical rapper role toughestbaddest guy around i dont think the cracked a smile in the whole movie not even when proposed to his girlfriendmorgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the moviekevin spacey wasnt good or bad he was just thereoverall its a dull movie bad plot a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors,neutral
907,if you watched this movie you know why i said jesus jesus jesus hehehe every time they said jesus jesus jesus i laughed thinking jesus jesus jesus why did i rent this movie i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen wtf is timberlake dreaful acting i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him but i really prefer an actor not this android called timberlake and his girlfriend was shallow hollow and annoying as hell i was happy when they both were popped in the streetthe story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all it would have been much enjoyable without himby the way the music was ok but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes low motion and things like that something misplaced for this cops movie i thought maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake,positive
908,how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up with enough cops to run a miniwar that include such weapons as flamethrowers you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying thanks to a corrupt copyou will never get your ish minutes back life is too precious to rent this moviei feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movieif you like justin timberlake feel free to rent this movie he does have a very major part in it so fans might enjoy seeing him however i believe most of his fans are young girls who may be turned off by the violence in this movie,neutral
909,ll cool j morgan freeman dylan mcdermott kevin spacey john heard cary elwes roslyn sanchez justin timberlake wait a minute justin timberlake and hes the star i should have known better than to rent edison force in fact i did know better but in a moment of absolute weakness i rented this stv when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an stv you know its one of two things an indie or a dog as in satonashelf which this did and with good reason the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la magnum force and journalist timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them he is targeted for his efforts or maybe i should say for his horrible acting i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing just awful the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard looking like nothing so much as a hobo you just know the director was not in control freeman is clearly slumming,neutral
910,i rented this movie last week i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it so it seemed promising and it was until justin timberlake came on scene he is a really bad actor and shouldnt be allowed to make a movie ever again i mean he is one of the most boring uninspired actors ive ever seen he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack i think matt damon would have been a better choicekevin spacey was another big disappointment his character is so dull it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in seen it might sound cool but believe me its notnow dylan mcdermotts acting is very good its about one of the very few good things about this movie he is just inspiredmorgan freeman is good but nothing special he has some really cool lines thoughabout the story although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good i was expecting a big twist when lazerov dylan mcdermott was killed but nothing really happened,neutral
911,review may contain some spoilers ill make this review short and sweet i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman how bad could it be right well its pretty bad justin timberlake plays pollack a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edisons police force ll cool j is deed a cop within the force on a special force team called frat first response assault tactics hes teamed with an ontheedge bad cop named lazerov dylan mcdermott in the opening scene we see lazerov deed taking on some bank robbers but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs i dont want to give to much away but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs pollack who works for ashford morgan freeman goes to a trial involving deeds lazerov he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford does some investigate that turns ugly wallace kevin spacey who is all within the frat team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justiceyou can tell from the beginning that freeman and spaceys performance are pretty lackluster the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me ll cool j is terrible in this film he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion he was much better in movies like deep blue sea any given sunday the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film the ending is far from satisfyingdont waste your time with this film im putting it on ebay this weekend,neutral
912,the plot of edison was decent but one actor in particular ruined the entire film justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen and should face the same fate as the entire frat squad whether it was an emotional scene an action scene or even a silent scene justin timberlake managed to ruin it do not waste your time watching this film dont even bother downloading it midget porn would be a much better choiceand justin if youre reading this stick to music even though youre no good at that youve done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing,neutral
913,i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial minutes of the film i managed to stomach minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead which by the way is great funthe story has massive holes in it the plot line is hugely over stated and dull the acting is awful especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at looking daft and singing like a castrato morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet freeman and timberlakes characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of fatherson relationship of sorts or something which simply isnt evident at all apart from the fact that though freemans character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover upit would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportiondont watch this film it is a pure waste of time,neutral
914,ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names i mean great actors like the freeman aka morgan freeman an asset to hollywood however completely wasted in this film then we got kevin spacey who ive been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes havent hit him yet well the reason for that i might add is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first minutes of it the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don corleone they got the one liners and soundbite worthy stuff the token troubled black guy ll cool j who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience oh and lots of gun fire i mean a whole lot spoilernot the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force whos crooked dead and the hero prevails they got flame throwers and rocket launchers really no kiddingbottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors or a great fan of justin timberlake to all the year old girls out there enjoy i wish i had more hands because then i would have more thumbs because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happeningmay gd have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies well it could be worst another rnb terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher hehe check out in the mix lol or even get rich or die trying now the special thing about that movie is that its got year old men playing or even younger teens i could go on with these,neutral
915,when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually dont care what the movie is edison started really good with some good effort from the singerswhowanttobe actors and a once again great morgan freeman but in a movie there is usually a good start to catch audiencedone a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action done and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie when you see elite police officers packed with weapons that can demolish a building shoot at a guy behind a car fail to hit him even once while he kills all but and then the guy takes out a flame thrower to kill the rest you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this,positive

917,ok i am not japanese i do know a little about japanese culture and a little less about japanese pop culture other than that i am spanish i eat paella and i like black humorgood with that point set i can comment on the movie i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences mamoru oshii is quite a good director despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head and even that was curious and somehow interesting and i am surprised he came up with this it may just be one of those lostintranslation cases i am afraid it is but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible the jokes seemed bad the script was overcooked i mean give the audience a break and shut up a little you damn narrator to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fastpaced speaking and absurd actionhowever i thought the animation was really cool the idea is great and it is well exploited in those animated scenes however the eyecandy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbojumbo speech over still pictures it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cutout hysterical characters scenei read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this the idea was good but horribly exploited maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie or maybe it will be more and more overnarrated scenes but hell if you thought talking head was dense amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a strokeof course all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european probably this is totally useless to japanese people maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation maybe,neutral
918,i dont want to go too far into detail because i cant really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie the animation is crud and the story alternates between boringpointless to extremely irritating the humor was completely lost on the audience and yes ghost in the shell fans this is not an action scifi or anything like that its an attempt at slapstick comedy and the humor just did not work after being translated it was a total chore to watch this movie and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything i wasnt expecting a ghost in the shell sequel but i was expecting something entertaining and it simply didnt achieve this yaaawwnnn rent kinos journey instead,neutral
919,i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments its not a bad movie exactly but its one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre plus it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways and the characters behavior often strains belief id say its a film that you would get something out of if you dont have a lot of filmtvliteraturelife behind you to be honest ive seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even otherwise its point has been made before and more artfully and that gets to the big problem which is that it really doesnt have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling and it doesnt really pay off,neutral
920,the plot for descent if it actually can be called a plot has two noteworthy events one near the beginning one at the end together these events make up maybe of the total movie time everything and i mean everything in between is basically the directors desperate effort to fill in the minutes i like disturbing movies i like dark movies and i dont get troubled by gritty scenes but if you expect me to sit through minutes of hazydark literally scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming rosario dawson one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here and no she doesnt get naked not even in the nc version which i sawif you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch descent take a nap instead youll probably have more interesting dreams,neutral
921,i saw descent last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and being a fan sounds pervy im not of raperevenge flicks of the s i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out my conclusion lets stick to the classics yes the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat the actors unconvincing even dawson is empty some would say that its a right depiction of the college world in the us that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial just like the scene where dawson gets raped it seriously lacks intensity i wasnt expecting anything irreversiblestyle but still arent we suppose to feel compassion for her i didnt not for a minute she was so lame all the way and i read that the photography was impressive well it is good indeed but nothing groundbreaking either i must admit that the screening at the festival wasnt so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie i couldnt help thinking i feel like watching argentos inferno again lol more seriously the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the americancanadian border in lynchs twin peaks fire walk with me the crude red and blue lighting the heavy bass music the general lasciviousdecadent atmosphere no i just couldnt get into this movie too bad,neutral
922,its pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself the paragraphlong plot summary written on the movie page has details i could not glean from watching the actual movie i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the bleep was going on alas to no availthis movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story if you could call it a story its like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations newsflash to the the creators i paid to watch you make a movie i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free and rosario dawson this is somebody ive never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face and i can see why she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie a or b i figured okay maybe she didnt really want the role just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasnt into wrong she was listed as one of the producers next time you produce something dont book yourself as the lead if you cant act if you really can then create a decent character for you to become also somebody here mentioned the whitelatino issueyes i hate to say it but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white collegeage males who wear baseball hats thats what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the storys antagonist as for the maya character she didnt seem like a real person anyway im ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made,neutral
923,having just recently reviewed lipstick for the first time in a few decades i backed it with descent even though i have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mineits interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the rape revenge movie has evolved in the past years from the fullon gore of i spit on your grave to the tawdry sensationalism of lipstick to the tasteful handling of the issue in the accused but descent though making some important points never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning no descent is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make a message that when examined closely isnt that groundbreakingi pretty much knew the plot going in what i wanted to see was the descent or degeneration of dawsons character being a big fan of rosarios i was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twistedyou know the kind of portrayal deniro brings to taxi driver unfortunately the script and the directorwriters choices dont provide any sort of believable transitionthe biggest point of failure is the second act it became obvious what the filmmakers intentions were for this segment of clubhopping drug use and obsession with big black stallion adrian every white boys nightmare natch from a qa on the dvd but this excursion into dawsons character is never believably rendered we dont know exactly what the hell shes doing half the time what shes after or why shes doing it the poor quality of the audiovideo again dont help but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless it destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally welldone first act by the time we get to the finale our interest has already wanedone point of success that dawson does point out in the qa is that by the end revenge scene we are pumped for retribution then realize just how drawnout and ugly the reality is while thats certainly valid it doesnt make the scene any more intriguingif you have the dvd check out the deleted classroom scene this is an excellent minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation though all verbal and really does show dawsons slow crackup materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor francie swifts prissy condescending dorm counselor if more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violenceas the film stands in the final cut though all we get is what weve seen before only in a more graphic rendering so what,neutral
924,revenge is one of my favorite themes in film moreso the futility of revenge is one of my favorite themes in film having seen gaspar noes irreversible i was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme instead this film is a weak halfhearted attempt which expressed nothing but the films lack of conviction and focusspoilers the end scene a gratuitous maleonmale rapetorture scene came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy however the film doesnt even follow through with this instead the drawn out scene which far exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized is crowned with a shot of dawsons face in an expression of either regret or this didnt fix anything while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the backgroundmy problem with the scene wasnt one of shock but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience i mean do we feel bad for the rapist do we rejoice in dawsons revenge are we disgusted by the brutality of it all do we feel dawsons moment of regretful clarity aside from this failing the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance characters are thin dialog is monotonous etcnormally i try to take films on their own terms but descent didnt really seem to know what those were thumbs down,neutral
925,rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge while its clear why dawson took the role its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent decidedly unhollywood film its also clear that aside from stunning good looks dawson seems out of place in the role forgive me i simply couldnt find her thats not a mistake thats how i felt i had no idea where she was yes i know shes on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever i blame the script for this since other than the ending not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense the people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didnt seem to fit together forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film other than the end which i would love to talk about but cant cause it would spoil it and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image stayed with mewhat can i say this may click with you it may not for me its time i cant get back for rosario dawson fans only though be warned theres several real reasons why this is nc and rosario please youre a better actress pick better scripts,positive
926,this movie sucked plain and simple okay so its basically about a girl that gets raped and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist the rapist is a douche but the girl victim is partly to blame i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff but when the rapist tries to have sex with her she doesnt allow it so the rapist rapes her and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesnt really expose or show anything but when it comes to the rapist getting raped its a pretty long rape scene there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching,neutral
927,im going to write about this movie and about irreversible the infamous scene in it so you are warned if you havent seen the movie yet this are just my thoughts why i think the movie fails in the end pun intendedacting wise rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger a teenager in other words the villain guy is good but loses his evil touch right before the end if he really never changes then why would he let a woman tie him up he wouldnt period then we also have the bartendernd rape dude actually i dont think you would need him at least not for the nd rape but more about that later onlets reprise the story rosarios character is sexually insecure might even have lesbian tendencies see her scene with a female friend this wasnt intentional as rosario states herself but there is sexual tension between them rosarios character meets a guy who is a sexual predator in all the bad senses but he makes an impression on herrosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before i beg to differ because she acts as if it is her first boyfriend which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother talking about her mother heres another problem after the first rape takes place rosarios character doesnt tell anyone what happened seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one nothing of that gets explored after that if rosarios character wouldnt call her mother anymore or would behave strangely the mother would be worried like crazy there was so much potential here also her female friend we see her at the party its obvious there is something going on and boom she is gonethe first rape is almost unbearable to watch but feels like a pinch when you compare it to the ending rape which feels like youre getting hit with a sledge hammer after rape no we get too stretched out scenes threads are opened such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian as one guy states who tried to hit on her but left in the open no real social contact is established if you leave the bartender guy out who is involved in the nd and last rape scene its apparent that he isnt a nice guy and his character gets fleshed out a bit but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again his being in the movie seems pointless we get the point that rosarios character isnt the same anymore that she went bad and is able to hurt people too many scenes show exactly that her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff back to rapist who cheats on a test gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again really as absurd as that sounds the guy meets up with her not without us having seen him beforehand with another girl very likely that he raped her too although we never see anything of that fortunately and his football career well career is a stretch and he is bullied this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works but then again is too clich to stay with you so rapist submits to rosarios character why exactly because he promised her it was her day again really a guy like that never loses control especially with a woman he raped before i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something but letting him submit like that just feels wrong another possibility would have a drug in his drinkso rapist undresses and gets blindfolded and lets rosarios character tie him on a bed seriously thats just crazy but what comes next is even crazier first she talks to him then she shuts him up and forces an object into him this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one this isnt about what this guy deserves or not its just intense and of course that was what they were aiming for now after she is done the bartender guy comes in and rapes rapist if this really should work as a revenge movie it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the revenge having a henchman doing the job takes away everything that was built upthis isnt supposed to be entertainingenjoyable its a hard watch it is arthouse but the minute i didnt count rape scene at the end just smashes everything rosarios character is more or less only watching what happens which brings me to the biggest disappointmentirreversible comparison irreversible had the rape scene but the movie went on even if it was back into time rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this first that comes a bit too late that should see her say that after the initial rape and secondly and most importantly this is where the arthouse movie shouldve come in it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope with what she had done but then again she didnt actually physically do that much see above a broken character that the movie cuts off good intentions talia and rosario had worked before but failing to convey most of the things they set out to do even if you can see what they meant it has to be convincing otherwise it doesnt work not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are,neutral
928,this movie was disgusting their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage what is garbage the misuse of peoples time the misuse of energy and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write talia you are a sick demented loser your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem the acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage i ended up at a scene that was uncalled for if you want to learn how to shock people watch a larry clark movie i lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie no more support from me how could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho i feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene i think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is congratulations you won his attention,negative
929,if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault then this film is not the film that you want to watch it was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back spoiler rosario dawson turns the tables on her assailant instead of using the criminal justice system the victim resorts to using vigilantism she in essence nullifies the judicial system the film the accused was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins what the descent does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence is victim any better that the accuser no,positive
930,do not waste your time or your money on this movie my roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called descent the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave so we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldnt be that bad it was i cant believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public it was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just cant make yourself i honestly feel emotionally scarred it went from being a semilow budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy shes dating to an all out porno flick and really not a good one i went from hating the womans rapist to almost feeling bad for him almost all in all an awful movie that was definitely rated nc for a reason dont waste your money and dont let your kids watch it,negative
931,okay so i found out about this movie and i watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether i should watch it or not before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time so i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought the beginning started off fine for me it seemed to be heading in a decent direction got past the rape scene and i couldnt figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie dont get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it didnt really bother me to a dramatic point then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on there was like minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didnt have that it had about of these pointless scenes where you see the main character maya kind of get out of control but it didnt show it right making me want to fast forward then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it wasnt so boring but still a little dull oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to mayas attention thats where it got disturbing i didnt feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it i cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its soi dont know i cant find a word to sum it up but if you choose to watch it just dont be unsuprised,neutral
932,this movie offers nothing to anyone it doesnt succeed on any level the acting is horrible dull longwinded dribble they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for complete garbage i cant believe what a laughable movie this was and im very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit a wowing nc movie the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something aimed at teens pathetic,negative
933,you know all those letters to father christmas and jesus that are sent every year well it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a halfforgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them as bizarre settings go its a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is dead letter office having said that this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one if it was royal mail most letters get this sort of treatment anyway i havent been in this flat for two years and were still getting letters for a mr wang some female priest of the church of latter day iveneverheardofyou and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing companydead letter office the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up follows the story of alice miranda otto who grows up in a seriously divided home writing to her absent father she only learns in adulthood that her letters havent been delivered for one reason or another so logically she gets a job at the dlo and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding chilean immigrant frank lopez george del hoyo slowly she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the selfcontained world of the dead letters office to its kneesnothing against this film but i was reminded of the godawful heather graham film committed while watching this however this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again that aint difficult for a start this film is much more logical true the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel it is also well acted both otto and del hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know theyll never find while other characters are peripheral at best part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed the other part is that when you consider australias draconian immigration policy ie if you dont speak english rack off such a story is unlikely to take place in reality the other characters sadly also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than oddball stereotypesdespite that dead letter office is certainly something a little different it might not be to everyones taste but i liked it yes it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes its nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavyduty swearing and nudity no chance of that in an australian film there aint any major laughs theres no bullet time and the characters are usually onedimensional but its the story that counts here and while its not earthshattering in its magnificence its a pleasant enough way of passing the time its the movie equivalent of a sheryl crow cd nice to listen to now and again but you wouldnt really miss it if it wasnt there,neutral
934,this movie had a imdb rating of so i expected much more from it it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous but before the movie is halfway through it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie but we get to know them a little too well they become caricatures not real people at all this is the same story ive seen hundreds of times only told here with slightly different circumstances the thing is i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog werent so stalethe only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon,neutral
935,dead letter office is a lowbudget film about a couple of employees of the australian postal service struggling to rebuild their damaged lives unfortunately the acting is poor and the links between the characters past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and overschematically represented whats most disappointing of all however is the portrayal is life in the office of the films title theres no mechanisation whatsoever and its quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living granted part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure but this sort of office surely closed in the s if it ever truly existed its a shame as the films overall tone is poignant and wry and theres some promise in the scenario but few of the details convince overall it feels the work of someone who hasnt actually experienced much of real life a student film with a concept and an outline but sadly little else,neutral
936,this picture seemed way to slanted its almost as bad as the drum beating of the right wing kooks who say everything is rosy in iraq it paints a picture so unredeemable that i cant help but wonder about its legitimacy and bias also it seemed to meander from being about the murderous carnage of our troops to the lack of health care in the states for ptsd to me the subject matter seemed confused it only cared about portraying the military in a bad light as a an organzation that uses mind control to turn ordinary peace loving civilians into baby killers and b an organization that once having used and spent the bodies of its soldiers then discards them to the despotic bureacracy of the va this is a legitimate argument but felt off topic for me almost like a movie in and of itself i felt that the war tapes and blood of my brother were much more fair and let the viewer draw some conclusions of their own rather than be beaten over the head with the film makers viewpoint f,neutral
937,when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers it was films like the garden of allah how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond methe garden of allah one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for performances in it then got two silent screen adaptions the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what hes missed in the world he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent shes traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a trainthe woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer im not sure what was in david o selznicks mind in filming this story someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience but you can bet that the moviegoing public of when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expectingas for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret the monastery will have to rethink its economics if boyer leaves the monks are a sincerely pious group but from the head man charles waldron on down theyve a right to be a little concerned with some self interestanyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts most especially marlene dietrich i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot,neutral
938,the real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor a visual treat to the eye the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart i was intrigued at first by the idea of dietrich and boyer leaving religion in order to find their capacity for love what follows is a huge disappointment boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment dietrichs amazing wardrobe outshines her performance at times her face is frightening to look at a unfeeling mask as a monk boyer held the formula for the monasterys liquer which reminds me of the true story of chartreuse when he leaves his marriage to god the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion the viewer feels boyer was well rid of his past however the journey that follows is all too predictable,neutral
939,as a great admirer of marlene dietrich i had to finally watch this very very dull picture it is miss dietrichs first color film and the worlds most beautiful blond is a redhead bad start the story is a tremendous bore involving a subject which itself bores bores me stiff religious guilt who needs it suffice it to say perhaps that of all dietrichs films and i have seen most including pittsburgh this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching the color photography is ok this is a very early technicolor release but to no purpose ridiculous casting c aubrey smith basil rathbone enough said the only thing of any interest at all is john carradines outlandish caricature of a performance as the sand diviner who foretells all that will happen the supposed happy ending is one of the most depressing ever conceived yet another example of david o selznicks highly inflated reputation did he ever make a really good film other than that one and for one final annoyance the soundtrack of the mgm dvd is a mess with volume levels seemingly randomized highly unrecommended,positive
940,my first full heston movie the movie that everyone already knows the ending to a sci fi thriller the campy factor everything that goes with this movie was injected in my head when i rented it and on the morning that i watched it it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood that i was in not wanting to move put in player hide in blankets and though i tried to understand what was happening to lead to the ending that will be eternally ruined by pop culture it just really didnt make it everything was all over the place relationships had no backbone the ending had no lead in everything was just kind of there in some freakish way and the watcher has no choice but to leave partially dumbfounded at the ending that it gets to because even though we all know that its people its quick answers as to why its people makes any serious attempt at enjoying the movie for anything other than the silliness thrown out the window,positive
941,anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics everyone says star wars and star trek are the best science fiction films to begin at which is fine but the truth is the terminator and this movie soylent green are far better choices than those series soylent is probably science fiction s best kept secret it remains one of the biggest yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day charlton heston overdramatizes his role yet it works edward g robinson in his final role makes the most out of it in soylent green more than anyone else and his final scenes are touchingit is manhattan in the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune a small jar of strawberry jam costs a big executive for the soylent company is murdered and police detective thorn is on the casethe secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie soylent is enjoyable to watch but the whole screenplay is a joke it is just as cheap as the entire production the screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie yet were completely hilarious everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules specifically cop thorn who likes to just waltz into people s apartments peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants the character s interactions keeps your attention on the movie but still you realize that soylent green sucks an enjoyable piece if you have the time but do not expect anything more,positive
942,i watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of sophia loren im a person who they call a cultural barbarian i hate art in any kind of shape or form rambo is more my kind of movie action kills blood horror if you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague no one dies no action no nudity nothing of the kind let me give you a rsum in a few sentences it starts out with minutes in black and white nazi propaganda every italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of hitler except for a housewife an anti fascist and a caretaker the housewife who is cheated by her husband meets the anti fascist she falls in love with him wants to make love to him but the anti fascist is gay despite of this they make love with each other at the end of the day the housewife reads a book from her gay lover and the guy himself is deported by agents the end you want an even shorter rsum boring that short enough the guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself to save the audience from this atrocity on a side note my sister loved this movie like i said im a cultural barbarian,neutral
943,fever pitch isnt a bad film its a terrible filmis it possible american movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that theyll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs thats the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy and i use that term loosely because theres nothing funny in this film is getting good reviewsi sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funnythe brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film he adapted fever pitch for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in peter hedges found hornbys voice for about a boy and when high fidelity was americanized for a movie in writers dv devincentis steve pink john cusack and scott rosenberg didnt go wrong because they kept the essence of hornbys wit and humor they made one of the best films of that yearso why does the american version of fever pitch go so painfully awry the british version wasnt a masterpiece but it was charming funny unexpected and gave us two characters we could like respect and understandbut ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornbys work in americanizing the story theyve butchered it removing all that was good and unique about hornbys work and replacing it with conventional driveltheyve transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy never once veering from the wretched formula lindsey drew barrymore has three girlfriends each of whom has a distinct function ones overweight the seconds cynical and ambitious and the thirds a romantic want to guess how many male friends ben jimmy fallon haswhat made high fidelity such fun was not only a good leading man and lady but engaging supporting characters in this fever pitch the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny theyre so insignificant theyre not even decorative the only reason theyre in the film is because the formula demands it poor ione skye winds up as one lindseys pals in a thankless role the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away come to think of it cusack wouldve made an excellent ben of course cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious scriptthere isnt a single solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced every plot turn is predictable every lame joke telegraphed ganz and mandel labor for laughs the first minutes are so excruciatingly slow you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch its almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing gurus formula pasted on the wall when they got to a certain page they looked up at the formula and said ok the guru says this has to happen now and prestodirectors bobby and peter farrelly dont help the film any they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters they hand over the vo narration not to the protagonist but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park thanks to some extremely clunky writing we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetingsbarrymore does cute and adorable better than most shes as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday but even her cuteness cant save this extraordinarily awful film she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story about minutes into the film lindsey tells ben youre funny the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script for fallons ben never says anything even remotely funny fallon is neither witty nor funny when he does comedy he overactsfallon was never any good on saturday night live he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices the only reason weekend update worked occasionally was because fallons cohort tina fey knows a thing or two about comedyactors who think theyre funny and behave that way rarely if ever are actually funny thats true of fallon he thinks hes hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle his stuttering unsureofhimself shtick didnt work on the small screen its lousier on the big screenunfortunately for fallon his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments if you thought his comedy was bad wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff two scenes in particular the first in a park the second in front of bens school are painful to watch the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work his range of emotions doesnt even run the gamut from a to bben has no personality or depth often he comes across as an oaf and not a lovable one at that it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him compare fallons performance to firths in the british version and youll understand how terribly flat unfunny and forced fallons ben is and how wrong he is for this role watching fallon in fever pitch makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcherjust as high fidelity did an americanized fever pitch couldve worked brilliantly it just needed better writers more competent directors and most definitely a stronger funnier smarter leading man do yourself a huge favor avoid this rotten film rent the british version and read hornbys book instead,neutral
944,i am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many but this was simply not a very good attempt its got nothing to do with comparisons with the british original have not seen and doubt i will it has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performancecharacter from its supposed male lead jimmy fallonfallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a year old and acting a decade younger than that hes supposed to be a teacher you see and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach the character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that i have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable but old reliables like john cusack or adam sandler might have been able to give it a shot not fallon who is neither funny nor an actor but appears to think he is both not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe fallon in his role or believe that there is any way these two people should or would be together near the end of the movie there is a scene where barrymore who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone its hard to have a one person romance tells fallon that its over too much has happened and shes moving on and rather than feeling bad about the scene or sorry for fallon you are actively cheering her on finally she does what she should have done months ago but of course the plot mechanics wont allow that to be the end of it an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else,neutral
945,i saw this directors woman on the beach and could not understand the good to great reviews this film is much like that one two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else like his other films you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten pretty uninteresting characters if you feel you can like this film dont let my review stop you i do like minimalism in films but i feel tsai mingliangs films are far superior he has a fairly terrific actor in lee kangsheng in his films there is nothing here i wish iu liked it but i dont oh well,positive
946,this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description but to me it was a bit of a let down very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed definitely not in sequential order also nothing of any consequence was being filmed i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewers part which is different from the typical hollywood film but this one befuddled me to no end i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didnt do anything for me i still dont really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a persons life i guess he succeeded but i was looking for more needless to say i cant recommend this movie to anyone,neutral
947,this typically melodramatic bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of western critics the script is ludicrous the acting is overthetop and it looks cheesy the only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary meena kumari watching the actress who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age shortly after the film was released has the same fascination as watching a train wreck her exhusband amrohi wrote and directed but lacks the competency to execute either task well bollywood has produced far better films,neutral
948,this was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares for a horror or thriller film and hype its way too tame there are only a few tense moments in here not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre even those tense scenes werent much the music made them more dramatic that they actually werethere is a lot of symbolism in here so the elitist critics label this a thinking persons horror film well if they think about it im sure they will come to the same conclusion i did a waste of money at the video rental storesummary a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting vastly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised,neutral
949,after reading some very good reviews about this film i thought i would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film i thought i would give it my own review this is my first ever so bare with mefirst of all i would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me i would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as i wasnt particularly thrilled either the film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times during these times she visits a house which she has been drawing after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality as she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in until she adds her constantly away father to the house due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutchesthink its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of a nightmare on elm street but is more like a trip to the beachin conclusion my generous will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab,neutral
950,normally im not the sort to be scared by horror movies but this movie is the exception some how this movie got into my mind it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout another seen was the family photo i wasnt expecting that and i jumped out my seat i would recommend everyone to see this movie with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time,neutral
951,i was rooting for this film as its a remake of a s childrens tv series escape into night which though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd fascinating and disturbing the acting in paperhouse is wooden unintentionally a joke the overdubs didnt add tension they only reinforced that i was sat watching a botch casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth chemistry or conviction as in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted consoled and reassured that they will not be held responsible out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen lamer than i could have dreamtescape into night deserves a proper remake written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind,positive
952,an intriguing premise of handdrawn fantasy come to life in a childs fever dreams however i imagine the average nonfictional child is far more adept at scaring themselves than bernard rose is at riveting the viewer the duel between annas two realities drags on far too long to sustain interest especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most abrasive child actor ive ever seenuse only for kindling,positive
953,in paperhouse was hailed as a thinking mans horror film wow you might say sign me up this thing is a mess it features a one time young actress who has a range of like to g headley with a bad british dubbed accent and a story with no chills thrills or spillsit isnt even interesting psychobabble one will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of leprechaun the story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams what you get isnt good horror art house or even a decent afterschool special i found myself after the two hour point sayingwhere did my two hours gothe direction is uninspired and i wished it could even be pretentioussomething interestingit seems like the producers were on lithiumeven in the dream world things are boringa short no on this one,neutral
954,films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning while there are some exceptions the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes the kids in paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds as theyre both very annoying and they dont have an ounce of acting ability between them in short theyre rubbish this isnt good considering that theyre the leads and it especially isnt good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors its a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isnt not completely it follows a young girl who after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created it soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings and so sets about making various changes until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare oh dearas you can see this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie however it is squandered through a number of fatal faults first and foremost in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness the movie is extremely stale the central plot is hardly played with at all and the result is an entirely boring experience the lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just dont care any more which is due to a lack of ideas thanks in part to its lead characters the film feels like a kids movie throughout this is to be expected as it stars kids but bernard rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story as the horror in the movie is laughable at best the film is also very cheesy and the romance between the two leads is extremely cringeworthy and makes for very painful viewing in fact if i had to sum this travesty up in one word i would choose painful paperhouse is poorly acted laughably plotted very corny and dull on the whole save yourself the pain see something else,neutral
955,first i liked that movie it seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments the costume designer albert wolsky did his best the same as wonderful set decorator robert r benton this man really had a very good taste but the script writers disappointed me extremely the best ending would be the scene on the ladder but instead of it they decided that the father and his daughter should be together dont like the ending the father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his exwife knows about it and finds it alright it would be ok if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body but they did not they only deprived him of memories the actors were good they were really funny cybill shepherd was charming robert downey jr was very funny in the dancing scene but some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting for example corinne jeffries played by cybill shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him years its a long time she was true to him she loved nobody but him and when she met him and was just about making love to him after a scene with her friend philip train ryan oneal she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years it would be a good movie if not the ending and some missed human psychology,positive
956,predictable plot simple dialogue shockingly unemotional performances but robert downey jr is so cute i gave this poor mans afternoon special a instead of the or it so richly deserved,neutral
957,chances are a big mistake to see you could know director emile ardolino from dirty dancing and sister act and should expect something amusing from him but i guess i have to disillusion you he made a really really bad movieaccording to the story christopher mcdonald dies to reburn as a baby the baby grows up robert downey jr and jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter mary stuart masterson complicated huhthey fall in love with each other then appears jr former wife cybill shepherd and jr falls in love with her too i guess i dont even have to mention that she loves ryan oneilin one of his first roles robert downey jrs on his worst he copies michael j foxafter the moonlighting shepherd proves that shes not suitable for acting in moviesanyway theres one thing this unfunny comedy can be used as antidote to insomnia,neutral
958,chances are if i watched this again i might get physically sick the film is so annoyingunless you believe in psychics reincarnation and the other hocus pocus which this promotes bigtime the recycling of souls they call it here puhleezethis story has been done several times before with such films as heaven can wait its also been done a lot better too bad they had to waste the talents of robert downey jr cybill shepherd ryan oneal and mary stuart mastersonat least its a pretty tame film languagewise thats about the only redeeming quality of this movie,neutral
959,silly simplistic and short gun crazy volume a woman from nowhere goes nowherethis brief just over sixty minutes tale isnt so much inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns as it is a ripoff of sam raimis the quick the dead his admitted homage to the spaghetti westerns brought into a contemporary setting in quick dead sharon stones character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff played by gene hackman who when she was but an urchin placed the fate of her father a brief cameo by gary sinise in her hands she accidentally shot him through the head in gun crazy saki played by the nimble ryoko yonekura seeks revenge against the dastardly mr tojo played with minimalist appeal by shingo tsurumi who when she was but an urchin placed the fate of her father in her hands she let her foot slip off the clutch and dear ole dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck the only significant difference despite the settings is the fact that tojo sadistically cripples saki with well i wont spoil that for you in case you decide to watch itin short saki a pale imitation of the clint eastwoods man with no name rides into the town basically theres a auto shop and a tavern alongside an american military base so i guess that suffices for a town corrupted by tojo the local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored confessing her true self as a bounty hunter saki takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of johnny to and john woo of course by the end of the film saki has endured her fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys but she rises to the occasion on her knees in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending and vanquishes all of her enemies with a rocket launcherdont ask where she gets the rocket launcher just watch it for yourself try not to laughthe image quality is average for the dvd release there is a grainy quality to several sequences but all in all this isnt a bad transfer the sound quality leaves a bit to the imagination at times but again it isnt a bad transferrather its a bad film,negative
960,oh dear i was so disappointed that this movie was just a ripoff of japans ringu well i guess the us made their version of it as well but at least it was an outright remake so so sad i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country so i cant believe this had to happen claudine and kris are such big names there surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines you do not have to stoop this low to make money there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them,neutral
961,i would have given this movie a out of if it werent for ms claudine barrettos performance and i will take this time to overlook that kris aquinos here and endi really avoid watching pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that some writers dont give enough attention to the characters and their progression in their stories redundant it was as if they pushed the movie onwards when their storytelling stank and my goodness creative exhaustion led them to ripoff other movies why why did this movie get a good review i wouldnt give it that much merit the movie was kind of scary but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with filipino folklore it goes into my list of most likely to happen category i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences never mind if the lighting sucked it wouldnt matter much if the content would blow you away sayang,positive
962,how did this become a blockbuster dear god i dont know where to start why this movie sucked too much the movie was predictable there was no originality the only thing i can admire is the acting of some characters the movie was too bright they should have done something with the lighting eg making the environment more darker the make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a horror flick this is people dont get scared by other people wearing heavy make up most of the horror scenes were taken from other hollywood or asian horror movies total rip off this is why i dont watch tagalog movies the only reason why so many people screamed while watching this movie is because of conformity how many times do we have to copy scenes from the ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the tv its now coming from the window next door no matter how you put it its still a rip off if you want a good horror movie go watch the best horror movie listed on this website,positive
963,so i got a hold of this as an assignment for trent harris who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the u of u i guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his filmthe documentary section at the beginning dragged on yes the kid is a nutjob from no where but thats not good enough to keep it interestingseeing sean penn dressed as a onj is the only highlight and after about thirty seconds it loses all humorwhen crispin glover takes on larry the storytelling was better but i just couldnt take anymore,neutral
964,its amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all it is by far the number worst movie i have ever seennot only have i ever been this bored before luckily not for more then hours the preadolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted after the first very awkward part you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better you hope in vain it only goes downhill from therethe movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this nonstory three times one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and trent harris never lays his hands on a camera again,neutral
965,i dont think any player in hollywood history lasted as long as david niven did given most of the weak films he had to carry by dint of his incredible charm he could act got an oscar for it but most of the material he did was as light as one ply of two ply tissue paperhappy go lovely is a case in point its a musical and for the most part youll remember veraellens dancing youll remember that they are in scots costume as the film is set in edinburgh during their festival but if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memorythe plot is light veraellen is the american lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town tryout in edinburgh she starts in the chorus and runs late one day she gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king everybody now assumes shes the main squeeze of the millionaire doors open up as theyve never opened beforethe millionaire is david niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake cesar romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musicalin the end though happy go lovely is light and harmless fluff which david niven did so much of and got so tired of,positive
966,the oddlynamed veraellen was to movie dancing what sonja henie was to movie iceskating blonde girlish always delightful to watch but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material when i watch veraellens sexy apache dance with gene kelly in words and music i cant help noticing that her blouse yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes seems to be made out of the south vietnam flag for some reason the very american veraellen starred in two musicals made several years apart set in edinburgh a city not noted for its tapdancers lets be happy and happy go lovelyin the latter cesar romero plays an american impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in edinburgh theres a vague attempt to link this show to the edinburgh festival which is nonsense the festival is not a showcase for splashy legshows we also see a couple of stock shots of the royal mile apart from a few highland accents theres absolutely no attempt to convey scottish atmosphere in this movie the funniest gag occurs at the very beginning when we learn that the title of romeros show is frolics to you this is a cheeky pun that britons will get and yanks wontveraellen is as usual cute and appealing and an impressive dancer but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad the plot mistaken identity between magnate david niven and reporter gordon jackson is brainless though no more so than the plots of several dozen hollywood musicals romero is less annoying than usual here probably because for once he isnt required to convince us that hes interested in bedding the heroinethe single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of bobby howes the father of sally ann howes was a major star of west end stage musicals his wistful rendition of shes my lovely was a big hit in britain in here he shows up in several scenes as romeros dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number nor even any real comedy its absolutely criminal that this movie with a title containing the word lovely sure to evoke howess greatest hit would cast a major british musical star but give him nothing to dothe delightful character actress ambrosine phillpotts whom i worked with once shines in one restaurant sequence and theres a glimpse of the doomed beauty kay kendall as veraellens confidante somebody named diane hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices ive ever heard it sounds like an attempt to imitate joan greenwood and glynis johns both at the same go but doesnt match either val guest has a story credit but this movie doesnt come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies the colour photography is wretched though i realise that postwar britain could not afford hollywoods process work happy go lovely is at utmost best a pleasant timewaster with waster being the operative word ill rate this movie just out of,positive
967,happy go lovely has only two things going for it and those two things are veraellens legs this is a british excelsior films version of an mgm musical complete with second tier stars i would imagine that veraellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star but im sorry to say ms ellens chance did not pay offopening with a horrible scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy the predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin and with the exception of david niven cesar romero who is way over the top in his role of a producer and bobby howes who is totally wasted in a nothing role the rest of the cast is totally forgettablethe choreography is boring but ms ellen gives it her all she was never as famous as most of the other musical starsand she shouldnt be since she couldnt sing and even had a dancing stand in in several of her pictures but when she did dance it was just entrancingits too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine out of,negative
968,happy go lovely is a waste of everybodys time and talent including the audience the lightness of the oldhat mistaken identity and faux scandal plot lines is eminently forgivable very few people watched these movies for their plots but they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots not here they usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs not happy go lovely and veraellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana looking desperately for a star to play off it and instead she was called upon to carry the movie and couldnt do it the scottish locale was wasted usually automatically ubiquitous droll scottish whimsy is absent the photography was pedestrian the musical numbers were pedestrian cesar romero gives his usual professional performance chewing up the scenery since no one else was doing his part in the type of producer role essayed frequently by walter abel and adolph menjou david niven is just fine and no one could do david niven like david niven at the end of the day if you adore niven as i do its reason enough to waste minutes on happy go lovely if not skip it,positive
969,may contain spoilers if living on tokyo time were some bold experiment where reallife wannabe actors were given film parts on the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful prescription antianxiety antidepression and antipsychotic medications this is the classic psych ward combo that renders patients into drooling zombies all during filming then this movie would hold far more interest or if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep deprived before and during filming then tokyo time could be more easily explainedas it is this film is filled with lifeless lowenergy actors in the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eyes open in almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with every part of his body motionless from beginning to end his facial expression is best described as near sleepfret not about the actors speaking over each others lines because these actors can barely finish droning out any lines of dialog everyone speaks with a depressing monotone voice no laughing no yelling no vigor no one has energy enough to crack a smile the result complete and total boredomand it does not help matters that the direction is simple and amateurishavoid this lifeless film at all costs better to watch greencard which has a similar plot and has charm and energy or for an unconventional japanese romance story check out the long vacation which has an ample amount of everything living on tokyo time does not,positive
970,i caught this film on azn on cable it sounded like it would be a good film a japanese green card i cant say ive ever disliked an asian film quite the contrary some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean and i am a huge fan of john woos hong kong films i an not adverse to a light hearted films like tampopo or chung king express two of my favourites so i thought i would like this well i would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious badly acted film ever againi think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude because no one in this film had a personality and when any of the characters did try to act as opposed to mumbling a line or two their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake i honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted beforethe only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy because i didnt laugh once even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this a refreshing breath of comedy it was neither refreshing nor a breath of comedy and the ending was very predictable the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such thingsavoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting i actually think that spike of bensonhurst is a better acted film than thisand i walked out half way through that film,positive
971,i have never understood the appeal of this show the acting is poor debra jo rupp being a notable exception the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring the dialogue is weak the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode furthermore the link between this show and the s is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny clichd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that both happy days and the wonder years employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible pathetic excuse for a show,neutral
972,ive tried to watch this show several times but for a show called that s show i dont find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the s the decade in which i grew up of the episodes i have seen most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period take away the novelty of supposedly being set in the s and the show is neither interesting nor funnyif youre looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in america in the s in my humble opinion you can do no better than the wonder years,positive

974,why is this show so popular its beyond me why people like it i think its one of the worst sitcoms out there because its so popular ive tried more than once to watch it and i cant make it through an entire episodefor one thing the acting is horrible everybody is overacting to the point where its annoying to watch they talk in unnatural voices use unnatural tones and have unnatural body language ive seen better acting in a kindergarten school playfor another thing its not funny the plots are dull theyre not creative intelligent or funny shouldnt a sitcom be funny why am i not laughinglastly what is seventies about this its about as authentic to the seventies as happy days was to the fiftiesoh and what is up with ashton kutcher who cast this untalented dweeb and now hes making movies oh save us allif people think this is quality television it worries me,neutral

976,take one look at the cover of this movie and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film this is cheese filmmaking in every respect but it does have its moments despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives the story is actually interesting at some points although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personalityfree boyfriends the acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audiences attentionin the nutty professor a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer whereas in the invisible maniac a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible allowing him to spy on and kill for some reason his students boring fodder dont expect any kind of mental stimulation from this and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick,neutral
977,heres an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase low budget a horrible name our physics teacher who has about nine kids creates a strange serum that causes molecular reorganization students are hopelessly killed from fake coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies sounds like a resurrection of classic bmovies from the s right nope its not an example of high camp fun which is way way off the mark a glamorous showcase of breasts and butts ensues our desire for pleasure opposing the horror that should have had more in the first place bottomofthebarrel entertainment at its best aided by pints of red blood and dead student bodies atrocious movies like this would make the ultimately catastrophic guru the mad monk the work of an intelligent genius who has a masters degree in film production its an automatic f so rest easy,neutral

979,this movie is just plain bad it isnt even worth watching to make fun of it the lunatic professor is just plain annoying even suspending disbelief to allow for invisibility which i glady do for the sake of good bad movies and allowing for exceedingly stupid victims in a horror movie this movie asks for even more than that if you are looking for womens locker room shower scenes and random sexual encounters get a porn if you are looking for a goodbad movie get something else if you want to simply waste your time on an annoying bad movie rent this,negative

984,i dont understand people why is it that this movie is getting an i had high hopes for this movie but once i was about a half hour into it i just wanted to leave the theater in the vast majority of the reviews on this site people are saying that this is one of the best action movies theyve seen or of the summer year etc they say its an excellent conclusion wtf what has been concluded besides the fact that bourne can ride motorcycles shoot and fight better than anyone else he comes across what do you learn about bournes character in this movieabsolutely f nothing okay theres a lot of action but whats so great about the action in this movie i dont like the cinematography and film editing the shaky camera effect and fast changing shots were used too much and they get old fast i didnt mind them in supremacy because it was still easy to follow and was not used in excess and made me quite dizzy i was quickly wishing i had saved my for something elsethis movie has no plot all this movie is is a minute chase seen bourne who you learn absolutely nothing about in the entire minutes of the movie is a perfectionist at everything he attempts there is absolutely no character development in this movie you know nothing about anyone and there is a wide array of new characters that are introduced in this installment some people said that this movie has incredible writing and suspense what writing what suspense theres no suspense bourne is so perfect at doing everything he does i dont think he has anything to worry about if this is the best movie of the year i may just quit watching movies entirely many people have also said that matt damons performance in this movie is one of the best if not the best of his career what performance how many lines did he have in this movie i have some respect for damon because he has been in movies that i liked and has played different kinds of characters but a good actor is someone that you can barely recognize from one movie to the next someone who chooses different types of roles not someone who plays the same roles over and over again which damon doesnt do but an example of someone who does is vin dieselanyways this movie was a big disappointment to me i do not recommend this movie but i do recommend the first two bourne identity and bourne supremacy and i most definitely recommend reading the three books which are much different then the movies,positive
985,users who have rated this movie so highly simply cant have seen enough good films to compare it with have they all been brainwashed i have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this moviefrom the first bu is just a chase film we pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another and another and another and another do you see a pattern emerging there is virtually no time wasted on plot character development or boring old realityif you havent see the other two bourne films youre pretty lost if you have you only wish you were lost somewhere a long way from a cinemapaul greengrasss dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on united which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen but on bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character he runs he jumps he punches he gets blown up he clears tall buildings yada yada yada above all he survives he survives like a plastic action man survives which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension so he drives off a building so what hell survive yawntheres a girl thrown into the mix because bournes love interest died in a previous incarnation but shes just decor ive seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of captain scarletbournes own journey of literal selfdiscovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didnt know from the first movie he was turned into a killing machine big deal he finds out his true identity so what it doesnt have any emotional resonance when it comesthe twist ending is telegraphed and weak oh dear the more i think about this film the more i hate it ive already reduced my score to during the writing of this comment id better end now before the slide continuesi love a good action flick and i love a good thriller the bourne ultimatum is neither its a loud tedious series of flashy edits ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence the idea that it shows the way to the bond franchise is utter crap casino royale blows it out of the water,neutral

990,some kids are hiking in the mountains and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator he puts on the gladiators helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikersthis thing is just so utterly senseless its maddening heres a short list of things that dont make any sense a guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside the guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent arriving the next morning he was only feet away these two dunderheads then hear another girl scream what feet away but dont investigate because theyre afraid theyll get lost another guy and a girl are walking around and in about their th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor i mean what the first off thats just a really stupid thing to say secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together a wounded girl attacks demonicus and he stops her telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing um yeah we kinda noticed shes wounded and not dead because shes up and walking around but thanks for that tidbit of information one girl is tied up in demonicus lair and when someone attempts to free her she instead instructs this person to go and get help um look idiot if she set you free which would take about seconds there would be no need to get helpand it just goes on and on the whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods then they fight then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends then they wander around some more its just so damned boring and pointless that i turned the dvd off halfway through none of these characters are sympathetic especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time i saw him he looks like a kid in a halloween costume scrunching his face up to look evil he runs or should i say scampers around like hes gay the special effects are comedic the acting is for the most part awful and nothing makes any senseoverall maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue creating characters with actual likable personalities having some sort of logical flow to the action and maybe even making demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit but no instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death,neutral
991,my wife and i like to rent really stupid horrorscifi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh we saw this one on fullmoondirectcom and decided to add it to our netflix list now when i say this movie is awful i mean it in a good way everything about it the acting camerawork story costumes is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good i think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place i really hope that whoever made this film wasnt serious when they made it because if they were then that would just be sad if you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then i recommend this one,negative
992,this movie is so awful it is hard to find the right words to describe itat first the story is so ridiculousa narrowminded human can write a better plot the actors are boring and untalented perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy filmthe camera receptions of the national forest are the only good in this whole movie i should feel ashame because i paid for this lousy picturehopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline,negative
993,i mean really how could charles band the head of full moon let a total stinkball like demonicus out i mean it should never got the green light to begin with the story is repetitive the characters are weak at best there is no real story on tyranus other then hes a bad dude then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending thats right a bad ending demonicus rises the last survivor escapes a deadly cave in then a picture of chimera comes to life cheaply i might add and chases her out then as she is walking home ala funhouse a statue that has been destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason just to collapse on top of her i mean that makes no sense what the hell was charles thinking allowing this pile of puke to be made with four different movie companies they were that desperate for movies they could have asked me i had better ideas then demonicus thanksgiving turkey,neutral
994,this movie is about tyrannus a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead tyrannus we learn after about an hour is also called demonicus this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity psychology and ourselves the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little todo list killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin by possessing the body of a college guy he uses a magic mindcontrol helmet to do this which the college boy willingly puts on his head and then at several points in the movie takes off and puts back onmaria performs oral sex on a poor mans sean willian scott and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this utter misfortunethis movie is empty and will hurt you see it,neutral
995,okay this movie fck in rules it is without question one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made absolutely terrible but you gotta see it rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun its hilarious and the behindthescenes featurette proves it you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint awesome okay rent it just for this one scene two characters are actually walking in place for about minutes in a shot the director on the commentary says yeah the tracking was so smooth it looks like theyre yeah right man they are totally walking in place its so funny,positive
996,warning spoilers a really stupid movie about a group of young excursionists in italy that find an armor of mythical warrior with a demonic souls one of them wears it and becomes possessed by the spirit of a demon its killing time and several of his friends die under his blade to revive the demon corpsea waste of time for the viewers as the fine young ladies in the movie leave their clothes on the gore is ludicrous at best and the acting is terrible perfect pairing for such a bad script,neutral
997,for some reason various young couples hiking through the italian alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first james gregory lee kenyon enters a cave finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of tyranus when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse he then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead demonicus back to life this shotondigital full moon release is stupid senseless has terrible acting and sound and the los angeles national forest is a poor substitute for italy however its pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance whether bugeyed running around in cheaplooking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic latin gibberish about demons and resurrection kenyons ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed oh well at least hes not boring like most of the rest of the cast,neutral
998,this film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities its like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula grand prix not i might add the us grand prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win that is how far short this film falls now dont take this the wrong way i love bmovies around half my collection is made of bmovies but i dont think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film isfirst of the story for a bmovie isnt that bad it has potential there to make a bmovie brand were not talking friday th potential but potential none the less but what really lets this film down is the acting at not one second do i believe anything its like watching qvc except the presenters on qvc tend to have a heavier tanin summary id like to say ive seen worse films but i cant,neutral
999,i rented this one to see vanesa talor one more time she can act but doesnt get a chance in this clunker the opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes must have come from a stock archive because the movie is shot direct to videotape the production values make blair witch look professional theres a really cheesy animated statue but no other effects worth noting this movie is bad but not amusingly so the players would do well not to mention it on their resumes,neutral
1000,seriously i just wrapped up my first viewing of demonicus and words have failed mei remember a time when i would see charles bands name on a film and my heart would race he was never a wes craven or a john carpenter he was a bastion of hope for the little man the guy whose movies arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex but they still rocked harder than most of the trendy junk we otherwise had to endureand now thisa painfullyobvious californian walking trail doubles for the alps and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be an ancient cave i mean they didnt even try to dress the thing up with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was anything other than an old train tunnel ugh instead of a creepy demon gladiator as the cover implies were treated to a dude wearing the latest in walmart halloween apparel theres a pretty cool looking corpse who occasionally comes to life to belch and wiggle his fingers but he doesnt even learn to stand until the final five minutes why couldnt he be the villain instead weve got frat boy joe with a plastic sword ouchcharles band you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such tripe i love movies that are so bad theyre good hell i occasionally enjoy a flick thats so bad its just bad this one however is just unwatchable a perfect example of making a buck rather than making a quality film,neutral
